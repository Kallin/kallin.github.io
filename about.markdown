Welcome to HappyCampers.Dance, home of the reality-adjacent thoughts of Kallin Nagelberg. 

Here I post things I've learned and want to share, mostly on the subject of software development.

If you'd like to reach out, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kallin/) or at the email in the footer.

Enjoy your stay.
