title: "TIL 1: Labeled Statements in Javascript"

Today I learned about the [labeled statement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/label) construct in Javascript. 

While working through [The Modern JavaScript Tutorial](https://javascript.info/), I came across this language feature as a way of controlling the flow of an outer loop from within an inner loop ([labels for break/continue](https://javascript.info/while-for#labels-for-break-continue)).

Here's an example of how you can use a labeled statement to break out of an outer loop from within an inner loop:
```javascript
function someCondition(i, j) {
  return i === 2 && j === 2;
}

// Using break with a label
outerBreakLoop:
for (let i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
  for (let j = 1; j <= 3; j++) {
    if (someCondition(i, j)) {
      break outerBreakLoop; // Breaks out of both loops
    }
    console.log(`break example: i = ${i}, j = ${j}`);
    // Output:
    // break example: i = 1, j = 1
    // break example: i = 1, j = 2
    // break example: i = 1, j = 3
    // break example: i = 2, j = 1
  }
}
```

Having been coding mainly Ruby for the past few years, I found this feature interesting as Ruby doesn't have a direct equivalent to labeled statements. I wasn't sure if Ruby did or didn't at first, so I went ahead and asked
ChatGPT if it did, and it hallucinated some code that is not valid Ruby.

```ruby
outer_loop:
(1..3).each do |i|
  (1..3).each do |j|
    if some_condition(i, j)
      next outer_loop
    end
    puts "#{i}, #{j}"
  end
end
```

So I guess today I learned not to trust ChatGPT for Ruby syntax as well ðŸ˜… (though it's usually pretty good).
