### Notes

Start with the purpose for the team, which will include the team’s mission.

Use visual planning to create a map of possible valuable increments for achieving the mission.

Continue using visual planning to break the first few increments into the smallest valuable increments you can think of.

Use the planning game to break the first small increments down even further, into stories that are sized “just right.”

Use task planning to break the first few stories into development tasks.

Just prior to starting development on a story, use incremental requirements to determine requirements details.


- discuss pull system

- emphasize these are not estimates, but gut feelings.


- discuss tradeoffs of horizons. discuss how you can expect to learn from these releases.
