# The Right Tool for the Job

Ever since reading [The Art of Agile Planning (2nd Edition)](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/books/aoad2), I've wanted to put everything I could from that book into practice at my work.
With a recent project, I've had the opportunity to explore some of the visual planning ideas outlined in the book, with a focus on how it works best for teams in remote-first environment. There's a whole huge
chapter in the book about teamwork, covering everything from staffing to safety to purpose, but one thing in particular I wanted to zero in on was this list of required tools for successful remote teams:

- Videoconferencing software, such as Zoom, for real-time conversation
- Messaging software, such as Slack, for asynchronous conversation
- Virtual whiteboard software, such as Miro or Mural, for freeform, simultaneous collaboration
- Collaborative versions of task-specific tools, where possible, such as Figma for UX and UI design
- A document store, such as DropBox, Google Drive, or a wiki
- Inexpensive tablets for collaborative whiteboard sketches
- An additional monitor or tablet for videoconferencing, so people can see one another and work at the same time

Cheekily, as he does in many places throughout the book, right after that list James Shore suggests:

> As with an in-person workspace, do not purchase Agile Lifecycle Management software or other tracking software.

We've been using most of those at my work since well before everyone went remote, but one thing I haven't seen much of is a **Virtual Whiteboard**. I feel that there is a lot of untapped
potential in that area, both for more collaborative planning, and for having something that feels like a shared space for a team; something that has been quite difficult to replicate in the remote world. I've been using
Miro a fair bit, and find it incredibly intuitive and flexible as a virtual whiteboard, so I'll demonstrate how you can go about using it (or something similar) for all your virtual planning needs!
