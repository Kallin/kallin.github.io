# The Right Tool for the Job

Ever since reading [The Art of Agile Planning (2nd Edition)](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/books/aoad2), I've wanted to put everything I could from that book into practice at my work.
With a recent project, I've had the opportunity to explore some of the visual planning ideas outlined in the book, with a focus on how it works best for teams in remote-first environment. There's a whole huge
chapter in the book about teamwork, covering everything from staffing to safety to purpose, but one thing in particular I wanted to zero in on was this list of required tools for successful remote teams:

- Videoconferencing software, such as Zoom, for real-time conversation
- Messaging software, such as Slack, for asynchronous conversation
- Virtual whiteboard software, such as Miro or Mural, for freeform, simultaneous collaboration
- Collaborative versions of task-specific tools, where possible, such as Figma for UX and UI design
- A document store, such as DropBox, Google Drive, or a wiki
- Inexpensive tablets for collaborative whiteboard sketches
- An additional monitor or tablet for videoconferencing, so people can see one another and work at the same time

Cheekily, as he does in many places throughout the book, right after that list James Shore suggests:

> As with an in-person workspace, do not purchase Agile Lifecycle Management software or other tracking software.

We've been using most of those at my work since well before everyone went remote, but one thing I haven't seen much of is a **Virtual Whiteboard**. I feel that there is a lot of untapped
potential in that area, both for more collaborative planning, and for having something that feels like a shared space for a team; something that has been quite difficult to replicate in the remote world. I've been using
Miro a fair bit, and find it incredibly intuitive and flexible as a virtual whiteboard, so I'll demonstrate how you can go about using it (or something similar) for all your virtual planning needs!

# Planning Horizons

James Shore suggests that you build your plan out of 'Valuable Increments'. That is, pieces of work that are:

- Releasable. When you finish working on the increment, you can release it and reap its benefits, even if you never work on it again.
- Valuable. The increment benefits your organization in some way.
- Incremental. It doesn’t do everything. It’s one step in the right direction.

These increments form the backbone of 'The Planning Horizons'.

The planning horizons are a series of time windows illustrating what level of detail your planning should take, depending how far out you look.
There is no right size for these windows, but we'll look at what is suggested as a starting point in the book. These windows are:

- **Purpose**: this is expected to be unchanging for sake of the planning horizons. The book also has excellent material on 
chartering a team's purpose and mission, though we won't go into that here.

- **Possible Valuable Increments**: Enough high-level possibilities that fill the longest planning window. 6 months of work.

- **Smallest Valuable Increments**: A more refined list, with possibilties broken down into their smallest conceivable valuable increments. 3 months of work.

- **"Just Right" Stories**:  Stories that have been sized so that the team can deliver 4-10 of them per week. 1 months of work.

- **Tasks, Detailed Requirements**:  Tasks are a few hours of work each, obtained from breaking down the highest priority stories. 1 week of work.

With that in mind, let's look at how we can generate the necessary pieces to fill out these horizons.

## Generating the Possible Increments

There are countless ways to generate ideas for valuable increments. The book suggests a few, including:

- Cluster Mapping
- Impact Mapping
- Prospective Analysis
- User Story Mapping

It also references a really interesting looking book, [Innovation Games](https://www.amazon.ca/Innovation-Games-Creating-Breakthrough-Collaborative/dp/0321437292), which could be a great resources if you're looking for more ideas on... how to generate ideas!
For this post, I'll be demonstrating Cluster Mapping, as it's one of the simplest and most effective approaches. Generating increments via cluster mapping can be done in a few steps:

### 1. Brainstorm stories:
Review your team's purpose, and use simultaneous brainstorming (also covered in the book!) to generate stories that fit that purpose. Try to generate as many as possible, but keep them
high level as we're just going for the big picture here. Start off by providing the team a blank canvas to dump their ideas into, along with some stickies in case they're not sure
how to add them. You should start with something like this:

![Possible Valuable Increments Blank]({{ BASE_PATH }}/docs/assets/images/possible_increments_blank.png)

And after a few minutes of simultaneous brainstorming with everyone on the team contributing their ideas, it should end up looking more like:

![Possible Valuable Increments Full]({{ BASE_PATH }}/docs/assets/images/possible_increments_full.png)

### 2. Cluster stories into increments:







### Notes

Start with the purpose for the team, which will include the team’s mission.

Use visual planning to create a map of possible valuable increments for achieving the mission.

Continue using visual planning to break the first few increments into the smallest valuable increments you can think of.

Use the planning game to break the first small increments down even further, into stories that are sized “just right.”

Use task planning to break the first few stories into development tasks.

Just prior to starting development on a story, use incremental requirements to determine requirements details.


- discuss pull system

- emphasize these are not estimates, but gut feelings.


- discuss tradeoffs of horizons. discuss how you can expect to learn from these releases.
