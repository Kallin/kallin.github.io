# Section 1 - Improving Agility
- ## Chhapter 1 What is Agile
    - Agile name highly used, but agile ideas are largely ignored.
    - Early 90s 'CHAOS' report resulted in companies adopting heavy-handed processes to attempt to control development. 
    This became known as waterfall development.
    - By late 90s, anti-waterfall methodologies were getting attention, 'Extreme Programming', 'Scrum', etc.
    - in 2001, 17 lightweight process proponents got together in Utah. Created Agile Manifesto, w/ 4 Values and 12 Principles.
    > We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. 
    Through this work we have come to value:    
        - Individuals and Interactions over Process and Tools
        - Working software over comprehensive documentation
        - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
        - Responding to change over following a plan
    - ## Principles
        - Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
        - Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's
        competitive advantage.
        - Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference
        to the shorter timescale.
        - Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
        - Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust
        them to get the job done.
        - The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face to face 
        conversation.
        - Working software is the primary measure of progress.
        - Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to 
        maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
        - Continous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
        - Simplicity, the art of maximizing the amount of work not done, is essential.
        - The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
        - At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjust its
        behavior accordingly.
    - Agile teams define success as delivering value, not conforming to a plan. Look for value by finding ways to change plans.        
    - Look for opportunities to increase value by changing plans
    - agile teams in charge of their own process, and change it when it isn't suiting them
    - all flavors of agile focus on making progress visible, and allowing stakeholders to course correct regularly
    - 5 core concepts:
        - Rely on People
        - Deliver Value
        - Eliminate Waste
        - Seek technical Excellence
        - Improve your Process
    - the underlying philosophy—adapting plans and putting people first—is really, really foreign to most organizations
    - cargo cult: duplicate the outward view of something successful without understanding how it works internally.
    - People want Agile’s Cargo: better results, more visibility, fewer business failures. But they don’t understand the underlying philosophy, and often wouldn’t agree with it even if they did.
    - Lots of stuff sold in the name of agile. “don’t worry, you won’t have to change.” Uncomfortable ideas like “adaptive planning” and “people-centric” are ignored.

    - ## Chapter 2 How to Be Agile

    - Agile practices often perform double/triple duty. You won't understand it work until you see it in action for a while.
    - Least familiar practices are mostly likely to be cut, but are actually most important.
    - To use practices successfuly, follow these steps:
    - 1. Choose a subset of ideas to master.
    - 2. Use as many corresponding practices as you can.
    - 3. apply consistently. Could take 2 to 3 months to start working.
    - 4. After it's working, start experimenting with changes.
    - 5. Never stop changing; practicing, experimenting, evolving.

    - Introducing New Teams:
        -  Make sure agile is a good fit.
             - Choose an approach the org will support
             - Determine what org needs to do for agile to be successful
             - Get Buy-In 
             - Decide how to Scale 
        - In Weeks leading Up 
            - Determine who coaches will be, who will be product manager.
            - Product Manager meet with stakeholders and exec. sponsor to create draft purpose.
            - Ensure team has physical/virtual room
            - Schedule Team's Chartering Session
            - Ask Team to review new practices
        - When team is ready
            - Have team member plan their first week

    - Applying Individual Agile Practices
        - Some a-la-carte options to try applying include:
            - Daily planning
            - Iterations 
            - Retrospectives
            - Fast Feedback
            - Continuous Integration
            - Test-Driven Development

            - ## Chapter 3: Choose Your Agility
            - will agile help us be more successful?
            - what is success ?
                - better financials
                - strategic goals
                - market position
                - gaining understanding
                - risk mitigation
                - increasing capacity
    
            - The Agile Fluency model
                - zones
                    - focusing
                    - delivering
                    - optimizing
                    - strengthening
                - each zone has benefits, and you need fluency in that zone to reap them
                - fluency achieved when all skills can be applied without effort
                - zones have maturity levels:
                    - learning
                    - proficient
                    - fluent
                    - independently fluent
                - focusing zone
                    - fundamentals: business results, teamwork, ownership.
                    - pre-agile make plans in advance, ask for estimates, expect reports
                    - focusing focusing revise plans frequently, at least once a month, demonstrate progress
                    - pre-agile break plans into tasks, assign tasks to individuals,and judge individuals on tasks.
                    - focusing teams do their own breakdowns, assign work to each other, expect to be judged on value created as a team.
                    - needs organizational support to achieve; if they refuse, perhaps they're not on board with agile.
                    - takes about 2-6 months of dedicated effort to acheive fluency here, better performance within 1-4 months.
                - delivering zone
                    - prevent quality degredation through technical excellence
                    - 3-24 months to develop, improved performance within 2-6 months
    
                - optimizing zone
                    - teams experiement and learn, develop new markets, outmaneuver the competition
                    - product and market experts join teams full-time
                    - give teams full responsibility for their budgets and plans
                    - difficult to obtain permission. typically a year spent building trust first.
                    - fluency takes 3-9 months to develop, improvements within 1-3 months.
    
                - strengthening zone
                    - only appropriate for teams on bleeding edge of managment theory and practice
                    - full circle, bring team learnings back into organizational improvements
    
                - choose your zones
                    - if you can't invest in focusing, agile probably isn't a good fit
                    - without delivering, your code will eventually succumb to technical debt
                    - optimizing will give amazing results, but a lot to ask for the org
               
            - ## Chapter 4: Invest in Agility
                - make the invesments and ignore the practices, teams will improve  
                - perform the pratices, ignore the investments, they'll struggle
                - summary of investments:
                    - all agile teams:
                        - obtain buy-in
                        - create long-lived teams
                        - ensure each team has a coach
                        - assign work to teams, not individuals
                        - focus managers on work system rather than tasks
                        - create physical/virtual room per team
                        - for the first effort, choose something nonurgent
                        - replace waterfall governance with agile governanace
                        - remove, revise or work around harmful hr policies that impede teamwork
                    - focusing teams
                        - account for 1-4 month dip in performance dip
                        - include people with user/customer skills on team
                        - ensure team has access to someone who decides what to work on
                        - ensure each team has a coach
                        - ensure each team ahs access to stakeholders or reps
                    - delivering teams
                        - account for 2-6 month performance dip
                        - integrate all needed skills onto the team (testing/operations)
                        - ensure each team has a coach
                        - each team has control over its dev/build/test/release process
                        - for first effort, find a green-field codebase
                        - address security concerns that affect collab. development
                    - optimizing teams
                        - account for 1-3 month performance dip
                        - ensure team includes people w/ business/market/product expertise
                        - ensure each team includes a coach
                        - give each team responsibility for its budget, plans, and results
                - make time for learning
                    - learning agile will slow teams down at first
                    - teams focus on finishing features before moving on. may feel slower to those used to seeing multiple things in progress.
                    - can trade money for time, hiring experienced practicioners
                    - ignore agile certification schemes, likely money grabs
                    - if there's never a good time, that's a big red flag.
                - choose or create agile teams
                    - most orgs consider people their fundemental resource; in agile, teams are the resource
                    - need to invest in teams that are:
                        - cross functional
                        - fully dedicated
                        - collaborative
                        - long-lived
                    - when building Teams
                        - decide the purpose of the team
                        - decide how many people on each team
                        - determine which skills are needed
                        - choose people who have skills, work well together, and willing to try agile. perhaps self-selection.
                - choose agile coaches
                    - some coaches can handle multiple categories (focusing, delivering, optimizing)
                    - each coach can work with one or two teams
                    - player-coaches can work when dedicated to one team
                - delegate authority and responsibility to teams
                    - (when equipped) teams will make better technical and process decisions than anyone else can for them
                    - work is assigned to teams, not individuals
                    - teams decide their  own processess
                    - focusing teams work with stakeholders to adjust priorities
                    - delivering teams control dev/build/test/release
                    - optimizing teams control their own budget and plans
                    - if work must be assigned to individuals, red-flag; command-and-control is incompatible with agile
                    - if tooling is required, treat individual assignments as team assignments
                    - forcing teams to use corporate tracking tools will decrease their performance
                - Establish a learning-friendly purpose for each team
                    - a purpose that's valuable, but not time sensitive
                    - a purpose that's self contained
                    - a green-field codebase
                    - if deadlines are inflexible, wait until the deadline is met or choose different teams
                - Replace waterfall governance assumptions
                    - remove phase-gates and use an adaptive approach to planning
                    - agile isn't for everyone. if the company needs predictive plans, like command-and-control, waterfall could be better.
                    - waterfall works best with 3-6 month projects, with well understood domains with little uncertainty
                    - waterfall is incompatible with optimizing fluency, limited to subsets of focusing and delivery
                - Change harmful HR policies
                    - policies putting people in competition with each other makes agile more difficult
                    - managers who only valuable tangible output make agile more difficult
                    - if people's careers depend on making themselves look good, it will be harmful to Agile
                    - if there are bad policies you can't work around, managers must be able to shieid teams from them
                - Troubleshooting Investment
                    - team members not trying new practices:
                        - team didn't buy into trying agile
                        - team doesn't have a coach
                        - team feels too much pressure to deliver
                    - team has interpersonal conflicts
                        - teams being disbanded too foten
                        - team is under too much pressure
                        - team's manager neds to help mediate conflicts
                        - hr policies promote competition
                    - team members aren't collaborating
                        - team didn't buy in to trying agile
                        - team members aren't fully dedicated, or don't get along
                        - team doesn't haev a coach
                        - work assignment/tracking assumes individual work
                        - the team's workspace is inadequate
                        - team's manager is assigning individual work
                        - HR policies promote individual work
                    Team's software doesn't do what stakeholders need
                        - team doesn't have right business rep
                        - team doesn't have a coach
                        - team doesn't have access to stakeholders
                    Teams have trouble getting stakeholder attention
                        - stakeholders didn't buy into trying agile
                        - team doesn't have the customer skills it needs
                        - stakeholders don't see the team's work as releveant or valuable
                    Teams software does what customers and users needs, but isn't a business success
                        - team doesn't have right business rep
                        - team needs a better purpose
                        - team need to developer optimizing fluency
                        - team doesn't have control over its plans and spending
                    Teams software has long release cycles, lots of bugs, or operational problems
                        - team doesn't have people all delivering skills they need
                        - team doesn't have a coach who can teach delivery
                        - team needs to develop delivery fluency
                        - team doesn't have control over dev/release/operations process
                        - team is learning how to deal with existing code
                    Development is slower than expected:
                        - team is finishing up pre-agile work or still learning
                        - team neds more coaching
                        - workspace is inadequate
                        - team needs to develop delivering fluency
                        - team doesn't have control over its process
                        - team is dealing with existing code
                        - team is constrained by governanace requirements
                        - team is constrained by security requirements
                       
            - ## Chapter 5: Invest in Change
                - Understanding change
                    - process involves:
                        - late status quo
                        - resistance
                        - chaos
                        - Integration
                        - new status quo
                    - can decrease chaos through SIS
                        - Support - coaching/training etc.
                        - Information - transparency, communication
                        - Structure - describe how the transformation process should unfold
                - Large-Scale Change
                    - if you're not prepared for serious change management, limit to a few teams at a | times:
                - Making Changes
                    - more effective to make transformative change all at once, then to try and incrementally move towards agile fluency
                    - if you are already truly agile, and demonstrating focusing/delivering fluency to some degree, then incremental could work
                - Get Management Buy-In
                    - Agile requires management support, all the way to the top
                        - start with conversation
                            - help management understand what they can get, and what they might lose by not pursuing
                            - maybe better to not mention the word 'agile'
                        - get economic buyer's approval
                            - gatekeepers can't approve teh investments you need
                            - get the buyer to aagree in principle to investing in agile
                            - focus on the big picture
                            - demonstrate the 'summary of investments', and see which investment-benefit trade-offs seem most appropriate
                            - ask if you can make a formal proposal
                        - make a formal proposal
                            - describe concrete benefits, translated to your specific situation
                        - if management thinks we're already agile:
                            - many companies say they are agile, but are nowhere close.
                            - don't argue about terminology, focus on the benefits and existing challenges.
                        - if mgmt isnt supportive
                            - put yourself in their shoes. if agile can't help, but it isn't a good fit.
                            - assume the status quo wont change, and decide if that's OK for you
                        - Changing an org from within:
                            - question your motives
                            - have a solid support network
                            - find small pleasures
                            - dont give up
                            - respect is your currency
                            - stay within your spehere of influence
                            - cultivate champions
                            - find the gap
                            - understand why
                            - repeat yourself
                            - dont criticize everything
                            - don't seek credit
                            - be careful what you wish for
                    - Get Team Buy-In
                        - get team's buy-in first, best w/o mgmt present
                        - give people real veto power
                        - be honest; change is disruptive
                        - emphasize that this is an experiment
                        - if people refuse, see if they can reserve judgement, or if they'd like to move to another team
                        - let everyone know there is hard time limit to the end of the experiment where it can be called off
                    - Get Stakeholder buy-in
                        - w/o stakeholder buy-in they may sabotage your efforts, especially if agile is succeeding
                        - stakeholders are used to a predictive approach w/ documents, progress-reports and sign-offs
                        - agile teams focus on feedback and constantly changing their plans
                        - some stakeholders love it; they know what's really going on and can influence outcomes
                        - others hate it, see it as a meanuever to avoid teams making promises
                        - if you face widespread, active opposition where even a pilot team isn't acceptable, it may not be a good fit
    
            - ## Chapter 6: Scaling Agility
                - typical agile team has 4-10 people
                - scaling involves organizational capacity, coaching capability, and team capability
                - Organizational Capability
                    - as pilot teams develop fluency, they'll identify organizational roadblocks etc. you'll have to navigate those for each team.
                    - only once the organization can clearly support fluent teams should you push agile aggressively
                Coaching Capability
                    - each team needs skilled coaches
                    - coaches can perhaps move on once thier teams reach fluency
                Team Capability
                    - beware hiring agile staff to lead transformation; more bandwagon-riding than capability out there.
                    - if using staff augmentation, focus on boutique/independent consultancies specializing in agile change
                    - success on one team doesn't guarantee success on another. need to keep making the investments
                Scaling Products and Portfolios
                    - vertical scaling
                        increase number of teams who can share ownership of a product or portfolio
                        - LeSS (Large Scale Scrum) https://less.works/
                            - suitable for 2 to 8 teams of up to 8 people each
                            - all work against the same product backlog and share ownership of code
                            - LeSS teams are guided by a product manager/owner who decides product direction
                        - FAST (Fluid Scaling Technology) - https://www.fastagile.io/fast-guide
                            - forms new teams every few days, no team-level ownership
                            - quite a radical approach
                            - perhaps worth an experiment with a pilot team of 10-30 people
                        - problem: collective ownership easily turns into no ownership
                        - benefit: cross functionality is easier with more shared roles on smaller Teams
                    - horizontal scaling
                        - in theory each team should own an end-to-end slice of a product
                        - requires different types of teams:
                            - stream aligned
                            - complicated sub-system teams
                            - enabling teams
                            - platform teams
                        - can scale indefinitely, but becomes harder to manage as teams grow
                    - scaling vertically and horizontally
                        - divide org into 'groups' that are effectively stream-aligned
                        - when they need to scale, they can adopt horizontal scaling techniques
                    - the recommendation
                        - start by emphasizing team fluency
                        - scale vertically before horizontally
                        - if larger than 60-70, split into multiple veritcally scaled groups

# Part II. Focusing on Value
    - Focusing Fluency
        - plan in terms of business value, not tech tasks
        - demonstrate progress at least once a month 
        - change priorities when business needs it 
        - provide visibility so mgmt can intervene 
        - regularly improve processes 
        - collaborate well within 
    - Respond to business needs 
        - works with business rep to provide org. perspective 
        - stakheholders can rely on team to work on priorities 
        - team plans and shows progress in a way meaningful to business 
        - team's business rep can see and change direction at least once a month 
        - mgmt enables team to work at indefinite consistent pace
    - Works effectively as a team
        - generate its own tasks and plans based on business priorities
        - team considers their plan to be team's work, not individuals
        - members share accountability for getting their plan done
        - mgmt considers the plan to be team's work rather than assigning accountability to individuals
    - Team pursues greatness
        - embrace and improve a joint approach to work
        - aware of how internal relationships affect success
        - aware of how work environment affect success

    # Chapter 7
    # Whole Team
        - compose team with diverse skills and experience (customer, dev, coaching)
        - teams need skills, not roles
        - everybody works to broaden skills, esp. customer-related ones
        # Customer skills
            - difficult and important aspect of the team is finding people with customer skills
            ## Product Management (aka product ownership)
                - work with stakeholders to discover what to build, why its important , and who its for
                - lead demos, seek feedback, promote the teams work
                - teams need people with pm skills, not titles. 
            ## Domain Expertise
                - most time spent with team, figuring out details and creating examples of complex rules
            ## UX design
                - because software is iterative, designers can take real software to users and get feedback to guide plans
        ## Dev Skils 
            ## programing, design, architecture     
                - uses tdd to combine architecture, design, tests and coding into a single ongoing activity
            ## Testing
                - doesnt involve testing for bugs, team should produce bug-free code
            ## Operations
                - help deploy, monitor, manage, secure software
                - create pager duty rotation
                - analyze and prevent prod incidents
        ## Coaching Skills
            - teams need coaching in team development, self-org, and facilitation
            - focusing, devliering and optimizing zones
            - coaches teach team to be self-reliant, don't do things for the team
            ### Practicioner-Coaches
                - have skills and background to show rather than tell
            ### Player-Coaches
                - people like 'senior engineer' or 'tech lead'
                - tend to have less success making teams independently fluent, or understanding when to influence change
            ### Facilitator-Coaches
                - leads from the sidelines, typically teaching focusing zone practices
                - downside is they dont contribute a lot to day-to-day development, and orgs may spread them thin
        ## Generalizing Specialists
            - teams need T/M shaped people, to take on different types of work as needs arise
            - any specialist can choose to learn to contribute outisde their speciality
        ## Staffing the Team
            - if waiting for someone outside the team to make a decision, you dont have a whole team
            ### - Fully Dedicated Team Members
                - assiging people to multiple teams yields terrible results
                - OK to have people join the team temporarily on a full-time basis
            ### - Stable teams
                - never disband, even at the end of purpose/product
                - add/remove one person per month
        ## Team Size
            - book should work for 3-20 person teams, for new teams 4-8 is good, beyond 12 you'll have issues.
            - w/o pairing, have 3-5 programmers, w/ pairing, 4-10
            - 1 to 2 customers for every 3 programmers
            - 1 tester to every 2-4 programmers, or 4-8 if they have delivering fluency
            - 0 to 2 operations people
            - 1 or 2 coaches, maybe splitting time with other teams
            - this doesn't imply roles, just balance in work
        ## A Team of Peers
            - no one in charge of anyone else
            - people have say in their area of expertise: customers know product priorities, devs know tech necessity best, etc.
            - agile teams have lots of fun! 'joy' is a value
            - managers focus on the larger system that teams are embedded within
        ## Indicators
            - whole teams :
                - solve problems and fulfill purpose without waiting for outside help
                - members work outside their speciality to prevent bottlenecks
                - make decisions smoothly and effectively
                - seamlessly switch leadership roles from task to task
        ## Alternatives and Experiments
            - simple practice:
                - find everyone needed to achieve goals
                - put them on the same team
                - have them work in concert towards the goals

    # Team Room
        - rather than write a document for programmers, include experts on the team
        - doubles productivity, cut time-to-market to one third
        - effective communication: 
            - collaboration is better than conversation
            - in person is better than virtual
            - video better than audio only, audio better than text
            - real-time better than asynchronous
            - interactive better than one-way 

        ## Secrets of Collaboration
            ### Always Ask, Always help
                - you might not be as productive, but agile is about the team
                - to prevent disruption when in the zone, try pairing or mob programming
            ### Drop in, Drop out
                - listen to proposed topic, see if it needs your input 
                - if you are neither learning nor contributing, move yourself elsewhere
            ### Create Visualiations
                - whiteboards, index cards, etc.
                - create a model that people can manipulate when having compelx discussions
            ### Work Simultaneously
                - make sure everyone can contribute to planning tools etc. at the same time 
            ### Seek Consent   
                - leaves room for people to withold support without stopping a proposal going forward
                - if someone vetos, they have to explain why
            ### Agree to Experiment
                - avoid speculation about what might go wrong 
                - when drifting in to speculation, propose an experiment

        ## Physical Team Rooms 
            - not relevant any longer

        ## Virtual Team Rooms   
            - if some people are remote, everyone in person needs to use virtual room as well
            ### Remote Equipment and tools
                - video conferencing
                - messaging
                - virtual whiteboards
                - collaborative versions of task specific tools (Figma etc.)
                - document store
                - inexpensive tablets for white board sketches
                - do not purchase agile lifecycle management software
            ### Designing Remote Collaboration
                - make time for personal connections
                - ensure safety
                - make the implicit explicit. use zoom reactions etc.
                - upgrade your medium. move to audio/video quickly
                - enable simultaneous conversations; breakout rooms etc.
                - create a 'wall', info everyone needs to keep current
                - get tablets
                - respect differences in access
            ### Indicators
                - when you have a successful team room:
                    - communication between team members is fast and effective
                    - you're aware of when you can contribute
                    - no need to guess at answers
                    - members spontaneously form groups to solve problems
                    - feeling of comraderie and mutual respect

    # Safety
        - team comp, socialization outside work, education background, extro/intravert, colocation/remote,
            seniority, team size, indivudal performance. none of them mattered really except for psychological safety.
        ## Understanding Psychological Safety
            - be yourself without fear of negative consequences
            - propose ideas, raise concerns, make mistakes, without being punished/humiliated
            - safe to disagree with each other
            - everyone's voice is heard
        ## How to Create Safety
            - you cant force safety on anyone, you can only create a situation where safety is possible
            ### enable all voices
                - start a meeting with a check-in, make sure everyone says something, even if its just pass
                - split large discussions into smaller groups
            ### be open about mistakes
                - when you make a mistake, stand up, take a bow, and smile 
            ### Be Curious
                - show genuine interest in others opinions, dont listen to respond 
            ### learn how to give and receieve feedback
                - focus on things and ideas, not people
                - say 'yes and'
                - guidelines for giving feedback
                    - create an opening; ask permission
                    - describe the behavior
                    - state the impact
                    - make the request
                    - listen to the response
                    - negotiate next steps
            ### use empathy
                - fundamental attribution error: we tend to assume people do things because of their personality, not their situation
                - assume positive intent
            ### allow yourself to be vulnerable
                - share personal details
                - things that happen at home affect us at work
                
        ## Leaders Role
            - if you're in a position of power, your words and actions have more weight
            ### model the behaviors you want to see 
                - enable everyones voice, be open about mistakes, be curious, give feedback, show empathy, be vulnerable.
                - phrase mistakes as not having blame; ie. i made a mistake and this is what i learned, not "im so stupid"
            ### be explicit about expectations
                - be clear about what you expect from your fellow teammmemebrs
            ### dont shy away from conflict
                - avoid false harmony and groupthink
                
        ## Indicators  
            - your team has safety if:
                - team members speak up about mistakes and what they've learned
                - team members disagree constructively
                - team members bring up ideas and problems
                - team creates better products that incorporate more ideas
                - its easier to hire and retain people with diverse backgrounds


    # Purpose
        - too often teams are told details about what to do, but not why
        - purpose makes sure everone understands the big picture
        ## Identify the Purpose 
            - budget for team comes from 'executive sponsor', who are often influenced by stakeholders
            - at least one person has product management skills on the team
            - if there's one clear visionary, they should be on the team, no broken telephone
            - if team has multiple purposes,  work on one at a time
        ## Document the Purpose
            - Product Managers work to draft a purpose document, which should include:
                - Vision; why it's important to company and customers, think long term and focus on value
                - Mission; outcomes in next 3-6 months
                - Indicators; avoid talking about shipping things by a given date.
            - document is a guide to help people understand what the team is trying to achieve
            - a guide for collaboration, not a contract. the teams purpose will change as they learn.
        ## Charter the Purpose
             - chartering session represents launch of the new effort
            ### Review the draft purpose
                - explain the thinking behind the draft, to explain the why
            ### Consent to the vision
                - a consent vote will expose any major objections that have to go back to stakeholders
            ### Improve the mission
                - solicit feedback from team members; reactions and comments, and refine the mission
                - take a vote; doesnt need to be perfect, just good enough for now
            ### Revise the indicators
                - remind everyone they're not a contract, just a guide. will be iterated.
                - break into small groups, ensure evry indicator has a clear yes/no answer to check progress
            ### Commit to the purpose
                - get everyone to sign off on the new purpose
                - takes a couple days in the chartering session to complete, and incluides exec sponsors and key stakehodlers
                - afterwards, transcribe purpose, context and alignment.
            ### Promote the Purpose
                - make the purpose a constant touchstone, refer to it when explaining plans and priorities
                - invite sponsor and key stakeholders to see WIP, visual planning, demos etc.
            ### Iterate the purpose
                - 3 to 6 months, revise purpose, with a new chartering session
            ### Indicators
                - when team has a clear Purpose
                    - prioritizing features is easy
                    - pms have no trouble justifying their prioritization decisions
                    - developers contribute to planning discussions by suggesting ways to increase value while reducing cost
                    - key stakeholders trust that the team is building what they need
                    - the organization supports the teams efforts

    # Context
        - during context discussion, work w/ stakeholders to consider: 
            - skills available to the team
            - teams boundaries and interactions
            - rsources committed to your team
        ## Available skills
            - each member introduce themselves, and describe skills/experience they bring to the team
            - make a separate list of people who contribute, but aren't fully dedicated to the team
            - review purpose, have everyone note if there are skills/permissions needed
        ## boundaries and interactinos
            - use a whiteboard to create a context diagram
            - brainstorm who affects or is affected by teams work
            - arrange and group on board, and label what team provides to group and what is received from group
            - populate 'skills needed', 'permissions needs', 'resources needed' 'communicatino to provide'
            - decide how to simplify communications, and who is responsible
        ## Committed Resources
            - by now, team should have list of skills, resources, permissions needed
            - sort them into must, should, could have and dont need
            - discard dont need, and for remainders identify who can provide them, how commited they are, how to get it.
            - have team review and make sure anything important the team needs is accounted for
        ## Sponsor committment
            - review anything team is missing and ensure sponsor can commit to delivering them.
            - if anything essential isn't available, cancel or postpone the team's purpose
        ##Iterating Context
            - After the sessino is finished, keep a copy of skills inventory, context diagram, and committed resources.
            - post context diagrams somewhere
            - review every 6 months or so
        ## Indicators
            - when your team understands context and has appropriate commited resources:
                - team has access to everything it needs to accomplish its purpose
                - team isn't blindsided by previously unknown groups or expectations
                - communication is smooth and steady

    # Alignment
        - a team is a group of people who depend on each other to accomplish a shared goal
        - ## Chartering Alignment
            ### get to know one another
                - discuss the follownig questions
                    - who am i?
                    - whats something people learn about me once they get to know me 
                    - why do i believe this group is well-suited to achieve the team's purpose
                    - what's the most important thing others need to know about working with me effectively?
                    - whats in it for me?
            ### Create working agreements
                - start by sharing stories of other teams you've worked on , good and bad
                - generate a list of potential working agreements
                - make sure these categories considered:
                    - practices your team will use
                    - how you'll communicate
                    - how you'll make decisions
                    - how you'll help without being disruptive
                    - core hours
                - post the list
            ### Define Standards
                - create a minimal set of standards you can live with
                - focus on consitency and consensus over perfection
                - definition of done
                - coding standards etc.
        ## Iterating Alignment
            - limit work agreements to about 5; these are habits we're looking to adopt. keep knocking them out.
        ## Adhering to Agreements
            - tools cant solve interpersonal conflicts
        ## Indicators
            - teams have effective working agreements when:
                - team uses your agreements to prevent and resolve conflicts
                - your standards improve the readability and maintainability of code 
                - your standards allow team members to more easily understand familiar parts of the system


    # Energized Work
        - professionals do their best, most productive work, when they're energized and motivated
        ## How to be energized
            - take care of yourself, eat healthy, exerise, sleep.
            - at work, turn off interruptions.
        ## Supporting Energized Work
            - go home on time.. what about in remote-first?
            - pair programming great for focus
            - consider working agreements to keep everyone energized
            - a clear purpose is energizing
            - teams purpose needs to be achievable
        ## Taking Breaks
            - when you make more mistakes than progress, it's time to take a break.
        ## Indicators
            - When team is energized:
                - team has a sense of comaraderie
                - team is engaged in its work and eager ot make it better
                - team makes consistent progress every week
                - value health over short-term progress and feel productive and successful


    # Chapter 8 - Planning
        - Agile is adaptive, not predictive
        # Stories
            - Stories are reminders for things to about
            - Stories don't need to be detailed, not a requirements document
            ## How to create a story
                - stories represent customer value and are described in customer's terminology
                - stories have clear completion criteria
            ## Customer value
                - no stories for technical issues; customers wouldn't know how to prioritize it
                - spread technical considerations across all stories; aka evolutionary design
            ## Splitting and Combining Stories
                - split stories should remain customer-centric
                - some splitting options:
                    - according to priorities
                    - according to data 
                    - according to operations
                    - according to CRUD operations
                    - according to cross-cutting concerns (logging/security/etc)
                    - according ton non-functional concerns (performance, stability, etc.)
                ### Tiny Stories
                    - at least describe technical work in business terms
            ## Special stories
                ### Bug Stories
                    - schedule them as soon as possible
                ### Nonfunctional stories
                    - describe exactly how fast, stable etc. things should be
                    - classify both 'acceptable' and 'best possible' performance
                ### Operation/Security stories
                    - customers often have trouble thinking of these sorts of stories
                ### Spike stories
                    - purpose is to size the other story, not design the solution
                ### Clean-up stories
                    - parts of code you work on most often will automatically get better over time
                    - you shouldn't need clean-up stories to keep your code clean
                    - if necessary, phrase in terms of business benefit
                    - timebox to make sure you can stop at some point
            ## Prerequisites
                - stories don't replace requirements; need another way to get those (on-site customers, incremental requirements)
            ## Indicators
                - when you use stories well
                    - customers understand all the work they approve and schedule
                    - easy to explain to stakeholders what the team is wroking on and why it matters
                    - team works on small, manageable pieces, makes customer-valued progress multiple times per week
                    - stories are cheap to create and easy to discard

        # Adaptive Planning
            ## Valuable Increments
                - valuable increments are
                    - releaseable
                    - valuable
                    - incremental
                - valuable incremenets fall into these categories
                    - direct value - build/change/fix something
                    - learning value - released when experiment is ready to run
                    - option value - create the ability to postpone or change decisions
            ## Focus on one increments at a time
                - working on multiple ideas simultaneously feels good, but very wasteful
                - focusing on one increment at a time wil improve delivery speed and increase value
                - focus on small, valuable increments, on releasing one at a time.
                - cool charts to look at!
            ## Slice your Increments
                - once an increment is done, you can change direction without wasting any work
                - minimize WIP
            ## Your first increment
                - use an MVP to validate product ideas
            ## Adapt your plans
                - plans should be as much a plan for learning as they are a plan for building
                - to increase the value of your software, create opportunites to learn
                - delay decisions until the last responsible moment, maximize your information
                - the earlier you make a decision, the more likely you are to miss something important
            ## How to create your plan
                - use rolling-wave planning, add detail just as it is needed
                - distance each LOD looks into the future is called 'planning horizon'; horizons include:
                    - Purpose of the team - w/ mission
                    - Visual Planning - map of possible valuable increments to achieve mission
                    - break increments into smallest valuable increments
                    - use planning agme to break increments into 'just right' sized stories
                    - use task planning ot break stories into dev tasks
                    - use incremental requirements just befire starting dev
                - use a pull system to maintain progress
                    - pull stories out of the visual plan when you need more tasks
                    - pull stories out of the next small valuable increment when needed
                    - when you need more ideas for possible increments, pull them out of purpose/mission
                    - when close to completing your mission, you'll go back to sponsor and pull a new mission from vision/purpose
                - lots of great charts!
            ## Balancing Adaptability and Predictability
                - the longer your planning horizons, the more work you'll throw away when plans change, the more people will resist change
                - longer horizons are often needed for good roadmaps
                - planning horizons are a trade-off between less waste and greater agility vs. more certainty and predictability
            ## Adaptive Planning and Organizational Culture
                - adaptive teams will achieve their purpose, but won't be able to say exactly what it will deliver
                - use rolling-wave planning with longer horizons to match the organization's expectations
            ## Indicators
                - when you create, maintain, and communicate a good plan:
                    - the plan shows how the team will achieve it's purpose or learn how to achieve it 
                    - team members are confident the plan is achievable
                    - you release value regularly and consistently
                - when you adapt your plan well
                    - you consistently seek out new opportunitites to learn new things abotu your plan, your product and stakeholders
                    - as you learn, you modify your plan

        # Visual Planning
            - rather than saying 'do this then do that', use a visual plan that allows you to adapt
            ## Who plans?
                - led by team members with product management skills, along with other customers and stakeholders
                - developers may or may not be involved
            ## Cluster Mapping
                - simplest and more flexible way to visualize plans
                ### 1. Brainstorm stories
                    - generate stories based on purpose; big picture, long term view
                ### 2. Cluster stories into increments
                    - use affinity mapping to cluster the stories, then divide clusters into valuable increments
                    - mark each story that represents a valuable increment, discard the rest 
                ### 3. Organize increments
                    - increments that have to be done but not related to purpose, or learning increments can be added.
                ### 4. Review and Refine
                    - Tweak the design; it will be used as a visual aid to describe how the team is going to achieve its purpose
                    - At this point take a break, et feedback from team members, real customers, other stakeholders
            ## Breaking down increments
                - visual plan involves:
                    - 1. Purpose
                    - 2. Possible valuable increments
                    - 3. Smallest valuable increments
                    - 4. 'just right' stories 
                ### 1. Brainstorm stories and cluster into small increments
                    - start w/ most valuable increment, brainstorm stories needed to accomplish them
                    - cluster them to identify smaller increments that are releasable and valuable
                ### 2. Filter and Repeat
                    - filter out inrementes that are too far away or irrelevant
                    - divide remainder into 'highest priority', and 'not highest priority'
                    - repeat until you have enough small, high priority increments til fill 'smallest valuable increments' horizion
                ### 3. Prioritize
                    - at minimum, mark one to release first
                    - this is a good time to get more feedback from stakeholders
                ### 4. Play the planning game
                    - use 'the planning game' to break small increments into stories that are 'just right' sized
                    - if forecasting, you can add release dates to the board
            ## Impact Mapping
                - mind-map: 'why' goes in the center, followed by 'who', 'how', and 'what'
                ### 1. Start with the goal
                    - should related to team's purpose in some way
                    - could be condensed missions, next relevant mission
                ### 2. Brainstorm impacts
                    - how could people outside your team help/hinder your goals
                ### 3. Incorporate Actors
                    - identify who will create the impacts
                ### 4. Prioritize Impacts
                    - choose highest-priority impacts, consider setting targets
                ### 5. Brainstorm Increeements
                    - for each impact, think of ways team could support or mitigate the impact
                    - good time to collect feedback
                ### 6. Break down increments
                    - look for opportunities to split the actors and impacts, not imcrements
            ## Prospective Analysis
                - helps generate ideas by imagining future outcomes, great for risk management
                ### 1. Create the chart
                    - vertical axis -3 to +3, very bad to very good
                    - horizontal range from "wont happen" to '50/50' to 'will happen'
                ### 2. Brainstorm possible outcomes
                    - brainstorm positive/negative outcomes to team/stakehodlers/software, place accordingly
                ### 3. Review and Refine
                    - adjust positions 
                ### 4. Prioritize outcomes and create plan
                    - vote on outocmes most important to address
                    - use these as inputs to other visualizations or brainstorms increments that achieve positive, mitigate negative outcomes 
            ## Story Mapping
                - ### 1. Determine Scope
                    - review purpose and context, decide which topics story map will cover
                    - 'now map' described what people do today, 'later map' describes what they'll do after
                - ### 2. Define Steps
                    - tell the story of what happens, this then that, etc.
                    - write each step (user task) on a card
                    - useful on 'now maps' to note how long steps take, how often, etc.
                    - once copmlete, review from beginning to end, fill in the gaps, and expand with alt. flows
                - ### 3. Distill out user activities
                    - group steps together that fit together
                - ### 4. Identify outcomes and goals
                    - consider different outcomes/goals users may have and put them on the board 
                - ### 5. Create the 'later' map 
                    - look at activities/outcomes and think about how your software can make them better; what would be good/better/best 
                - ### 6. Divide into increments
                    - can you divide the map into valuable, releasable increments ?
                    - take a break, gather feedback
                - ### 7. Play the planning game
                    - steps from 'later map' are stories you'll take into the planning game
            ## Iterating the Visual Plan
                - udpate and imrpove the visualizations frequently; weekly.
            ## Indicators
                - When you create and commuicate a visual plan well
                    - stakeholders and team members not only undestand what will be done, but also why 
                    - the relationship between the parts of your plan are easy to see
                    - stakeholders and team members contribute new ideas as a result of their deeper uinedstanding of context
                
        # The Planning Game
            - a cooperative game designed to create the best possible payoff
            - breaks valuable, releasable increments into smaller stories, 'just right' for development
                1. Purpose provides the overall goal and current direction
                2. Visual planning identifies options for valuable increments
                3. The planning game provides step-by-step plan you'll use to develop each increment
            ## How to PLay
                - developers focus on size/cost, customers focus on value/priorities 
                - better to stick to one role or the other
                ### 1. Customer decide the scope of the plan
                    - product managers choose the highest priority increments from the visual plan
                    - kick off by reviewing how the tema's purpose fit the increments and overall plan
                    - explain what makes them valuable and what needs to happen before they can be released
                ### 2. The whole team brainstorms
                    - anything that requires the team to do something other than normal overhead needs a story
                ### 3. Developers size the stories
                    - sort into several groups
                        - just right
                        - too big
                        - too small
                        - you can't size because you don't understand
                        - you can't size beacsue of technical unknowns
                    - stories are 'just right' when the whole team can finish four to ten per week
                    - for stories that are to big, work with customers to spliut them into smaller stories, combine larger ones
                    - if you don't understand, ask your on-site customer to clarify
                    - for technical unknowns, make a spike story
                ### 4. Customers prioritize the stories
                    - customers add 'just right' stories to the visual plan
                    - customers, dont let developers bully you into adding stories you don't understand
                    - developers, dont let customers bully you into accepting a story that needs to be split or spiked
                ### 5. Repeat until the plan is complete
                    - create, size, plane stories until you've filled out your planning horizon
                        - is every story 'just right'
                        - does every story that couldn't be sized have a spike story prioritized before it?
                        - have stories been prioritized correctly, according to team members with customer skills?
                        - does the plan make sense, lead to the team accomplishing its purpose?
                    - ask team to consent to the plan
            ## Keep your options open
                - create a plan that allows you to release at any time
                - try to create stories for 'vertical slices' that make up a complete, small feature
            ## How to win the planning game
                - develoeprs ask 'help me understand my options' vs. saying 'software is hard'. talk about what's easy and whats hard.
                - in general, customers tend not to know what's easy and create stories that are difficult to implement.
                - in general, developers tend not to know what customers think is important, and create stories that aren't valuable.
                - time appears out of nowhere. tada, collaboration.
            ## Prioritizing Development Decisions
                - sometimes customers ask developers to skip important technical work.
                - if a development decision isnt optional, it isnt a story. dont ask customers to prioritize it. just do it.
                    - either don't mention it the work at all, its a detail, or mention it as the cost of doing business.
                - where there is a business choice to be made, interpret the technolgoy and describe options in terms of business impact
            ## Facing Reality
                - the planning game will likely give customers information that makes them unhappy
                - ignoring unpleasant realities oesnt make work take lses time, just means you'll be blindsided by delays
                - developers usually dont split stories enough vs. too much, err on that too small
            ## Iterating the planning game
                - when the plan shrinks below story planning horizion, time to play again
                - in practice, should take only a few minutes to discuss, size and prioritize a story
            ## Indicators
                - when playing well
                    - customers and devs feel they have contributed
                    - feelings of pressure are focused on the constraints of the plan rather than on individuals or groups
                    - devs suggest options for reducing work while still fulfiling purpose
                    - customers ruthlessly prioritize stories to best serve the purpose

        # Real Customer Involvement
            - in agile teams, on-site customers are responsible for choosing and prioritizing stories
            - include customers, user, stakeholders in the planning, observe how people use it and then act on feedback; change plans.
            ## Personal Development
                - the team is the real customer
            ## Platform Development
                - customers are other client teams
                - dont fall into the trap of making 'easy to use' tools. giv ethem flexibility/autonomy/ownership
            ## In House Custom Development
                - easy to involve real customers
                - recruit exec sponsor or lieutenant ot be the product manager
                - recruit some users to be domain experts
            ## Outsourced Custom Development
                - still important to get customer involvement on the regular
            ## Vertical-Market Software
                - PM needs to combine all real customer's needs into a single compelling purpose
                - find ways to involve customers, like customer review boards, hiring ex-customers, etc.
            ## Horizontal Market Software
                - intended to be used across a wide range of industries
                - focus groups, UX testing, previews, betas, etc. are helpful
            ## Results
                - when you involve real customers and users:
                    - you improve knowledge how customers use software in practice
                    - you have better understanding of customers goals and frustrations
                    - you use customer's feedback to revise plans and software
                    - you increase your chances of delivering a truly useful and successful product
        
        # Incremental Requirements
            ## The Living Requirements Document
                - on-site customers act as living requirements document fo the team
                - when developers need to understand a requirement, they just ask
                - on-site customers figure out requirements just prior to being asked; need expertise.
            ## When experts aren't part of the team
                - if on-site customers aren't experts, they need to facilitate conversations between team and experts so 
                    everyone can learn from the source
            ## Work Incrementally
                - customers work on requirements incrementally, in paralell with the team's work
            ## Purpose and Visual Plan
                - Identify the team's purpose and visual plan from the beginning
            ## The planning game
                - prior to the planning game, decide which increments will be next
            ## Mock-ups, customer examples, and completion criteria
                - figure out details just before developers start working on it
            ## Customer review
                - only working software shows what you're really going to get
                - minor changes can be addressed using 'slack' in the schedule
            ## Documentation
                - dont introduce documentation for the sake of documentation
            ## Product Documentation
                - you may want to document what the product does for future reference
            ## Operations Document
                - runbooks, how to deploy, etc.
            ## Governance documentation
                - dont assume audits require a particular process, they often require that you have a process
            ## As-built documentation
                - when disbanding a team or change purposes, make sure to take time to make it easy for whoever uses it next
            ## Indicators
                - when customers work out requirements incrementally
                    - developers work on established stories while customers figure out the deatails for future stories
                    - customers have ready answer to requirements questions, which allows planning/dev to proceed quickly/smoothly
                    - by the time the story is done, it reflects customers expectations

            
    # Chapter 9 - Ownership
        - Agile teams decide for themselves what to work on, how to break it down, who will do it
        - The poepl eoding the work are the ones who best understand what needs to be done; most qualified to decide the details

        ## Task Planning
            - breaking down stores into tasks and tracking the team's progress
            ### Cadence
                - two common approaches are sprints and kanban
                - teams new to agile should use sprints; strict cadence provides important feedback
            ### Iterations
                - allow you to detect problems early
                - follow a consistent schedule
                    1. demonstrate results of previous iteration to stakeholders
                    2. hold retro on previous iteration
                    3. plan iteration tasks
                    4. develop Stories
                    5. deploy (if not using CD)
                - one week iteratinos works well for new teams; the # of iterations correlates to their understanding
            ### Continuous Flow
                - establish a WIP limit (1 to 3 is best), the fewer the better
                - good fit for teams with lots of small unpredictable stories
            ### Creating Tasks
                - start by choosing stories
                - customers take highest priority stories and spread them out and explain to the team
                - use simultaneous brainstorming to come up with all tasks needed (a few hours each)
                - gets everyone on the same page about how to design
                - task plan should take 10-30 minutes, too much detail if it takes longer
                - if you get stuck on a question, dont solve in meeting, add it as a task
                - once complete, consent vote, brief stand up and get to work
            ### Visual Tracking
                - tasks arent assigned to people. whole teams's responsibility to keep track of progress and help out where needed
                - put the success of your team over finishing your individual tasks
                - agile planning tools, such as jira, add too much friction. it will only get in the way.
            ### Cross Team Dependencies
                - dont choose stories with unfulfilled dependencies, wait until next iteration or slot
                - if you face a lot of cross-team dependencies, you may not have a whole team.
            ### Making and MEeting Iteration Commitments
                - at first make the commitment internally, not with stakeholdeers
                - once you feel consistent/confident enough, you can share with stakeholders
                - any iteration that delivers all stories in current plan, even if plan is smaller than at beginning, is a success.
            ### Incomplete stories
                - if happenings, reduce planned capacity, split stories smaller, swarm
            ### Emergency Requests
                - for a small trickle of emergencies, treat them as overhead rather than stories
                - if there are lots, assign a developer or two. in between requests they can work on work that can handle interrupts
            ### Your First Week
                - first couple monthns could be pretty chaotic
                - start with one-week iterations, and start first day by planning the iteration
                - conduct a mini 'planning game' with 10-20 just right stories that everyone understands well
                - working on the first stories as a group helps reduce the chaos
                - customers and testers can work on the visual plan, draft purpose, etc.
            ### Indicators
                - when you plan tasks well
                    - the whole team understands what needs to be done to finish its stories
                    - the team works together to accomplish its plan
                    - the team is aware of when things are going well and when they're not, and takes action to correct problems
                - When you use iterations well
                    - your team hsa a consistent, predictable capacity
                    - stakeholders know what to epxect from teh team and trust that it will deliver on its expectations
                    - the team discovers mistakes quickly and is usually able to deal with them without impacting its iteratino commitments
        ## Capacity
            - prediction of how much the team can accomplish in an iteration
            ### Yesterday's Weather
                - capacity is number of stories completed in previous iteration
                - combined w/ slack, allows you to reliably predit how much you can finish in every iteration
            ### Capacity and the iteration timebox
                - never count stories that aren't done-done, and never allow deadline to slip
                - capacity is unstable at first, give 3 or 4 iterations .
            ### Stabilizing Capacity
                - be quick to decrease capacity, slow to increase
                - only increase when you had time to clean up code, work on other non-urgent work
                - nice 'slack' chart
                - excessive schedule pressure reduces performance
                - estimation accuracy doesn't matter, only meant for feedback into next iteration
            ### Estimating Stories
                - if you dont have consistently sized stories, you can estimate
                - to estimate, dont worry about accuracy, just focus on consistency
                    - estimate only the constraint, ie. the bottleneck
                    - let experts estimate
                    - estimate in 'ideal' hours or days. most qualified team member, no interruptions, etc.
                    - think of tasks
                    - round into 3 buckets, split larger and combine smaller. 
                - call the estimates 'points', not hours or days
                #### Conversational Estimating
                    - one story at a time, can be tedious
                    - should take less than a minute to estimate the story
                    - take the lowest estimate
                #### Affinity estimating
                    - great for estimating lots of stories quickly, and when you have long planning horizons
                    - put cards on table, estimators lay them out from smallest to biggest, piles for spikes and clarification needed
                    - its done silently
                    - bucket them into estimate clusters
            ### When Estimating is Difficult
                - one cause of slow estimation is lack of prep by customers
                - another is developer inexperience
                - only ask for details that would change the estimate
                - to help address issues:
                    - customers having trouble: they can huddle or put a question and come back later.
                    - estimators uncertain about tech: make a spike story
                    - estimators asking lots of questions: do we have enough info to estimate?
                    - story taking more than 5 minutes: should we come back to it later?
            ### Defending estimates
                - ignore people's tone, and treat comments as requests for information
                - change your estimate only if you learn something new
                - these sorts of questions should dissipate as stakeholders gain trust
            ### Your initial capacity
                - start with one-week iterations, should stabilize after about 4 weeks
            ### How to Improve Capacity
                #### Improve internal quality
                    - ie. tech-debt. 
                    - has a greater impact on capacity than any other factor. 
                    - make it a priority and capacity will improve dramatically
                    - rather than stopping, improve incrementally using slack
                    - be patient, should see an improvment after several months
                #### Improve customer skills
                    - improving developers' customer skills can reduce their reliance on on-site customers
                #### Support energized work
                    - shield the team from organizational pressure
                #### Offload duties
                    - find ways to excuse people from unnecessary meetings, perhaps add an assistant to the team
                #### Support the constraint
                    - don't worry too far ahead, ie. programmers helping w/ testing automation
                #### provide needed resources
                    - get people whatever equipment they need
                #### add people (carefully)
                    - expect new members to take a month or two to be productive
            ### Capacity is not productivity
                - cannot be used to compare teams
                - teams dont have control over most things that affect capacity, they can only:
                    - take shortcuts
                    - work overtime
                    - cutting slack
            ### Indicators
                - when you use capacity well:
                    - your capacity is consistent and predictable each iteration
                    - you make iteration commitments and meet them reliably
                    - estimation is fast and easy, or not required at all
                    - you can size most stories in a minute or two
                
        ## Slack
            ### How much slack?
                - depends on the randomness of problems
                - if capacity jumps around a lot, stop signing up for more stories
                - if you finish everything early, take on an extra story
            ### How to use slack
                - use it to increase your ability to deliver; probably by incresing internal quality.
                ## Improving internal quality
                    - team's performance tied to quality of code, tests, automation, and infra.
                    - dont batch up improvements; make them every day throughout the iteration
                    - focus improvements on the code, tests and other systems that you're actually working on.
                ## Develop Customer Skills
                    - join product manager to meet with stakeholders, interview users, etc.
                ## Dedicate time to exploration and experimentation
                    - given time, devs will learn things that enhance their work on the team
                    - set aside r&d time at end of iteration
                    - dont work on any stories or commit any production code
                    - think about what's puzzled you recently
                    - create spike solutions, small standalone programs
                ## The role of overtime
                    - never use overtime as an excuse to lower your team's standards
            ## Indicators
                - when you incorporate slack into your iterations
                    - team consistently meets iteration commitments
                    - team members raerely, if ever, need overtime
                    - teams' internal quality steadily improves, making work easier and faster
                  
        ## Stand-up Meetings
            ### How to hold the daily stand-up 
                - coordination meetings, not status meetings
                - ownership of all tasks is shared, so this is the chance to sync up on shared work
                #### 1. Walk the board
                    - for each story, describe what's changed, what's left ot be done, and any new info 
                    - may need a facilitator, rotate it
                #### 2. Focus on Completion
                    - focus the team on anything that hasn't been moving
                    - check in on iteration commitment
                #### 3. Choose tasks
                    - everyone decides what they're going to work on next
                #### 4. Take detailed conversations offline
                    - if any more indepth discussion needed, take it offline
            ### Be Brief
                - primary virtue of the meeting is brevity
                - should only take 5-10 minutes
                - if slow it may be because:
                    - using an issue-tracking tool rather than board
                    - updating the task board during the stand-up rather than throughout the day
                    - holding detailed diiscussions during stand
                    - holding the stand in a meeting room other than your team room
                    - waiting for people to arrive rather than start on time
            ### Indicators
                - when you conduct daily stand up meetings:
                    - team coordinates its work and makes steady progress toward completing its task plan
                    - team is aware of when a task or story is stalled and takes action to unblock it
                    - team members are aware of what others are working on and how it influences their work

        ## Informative Workspace
            - allows people to sense progress without interrupting team members and helps improve stakeholder trust
            ### Subtle cues
                - a healthy team is energized; lots of communication
                - unhealthy team is quiet and tense
                - in remote, need working agreements around sharing information 
                - perhaps keep plan visible on an always-on tablet or monitor
            ### Big Visible Charts
                - task planning board 
                - calendar
                - purpose (vision, mission, mission tests
                - virtual whiteboard is best
            ### Improvement Charts
                - only up for a few weeks, often the result of a retro
                - consider tracking:
                    - amount of pairing
                    - pair switching
                    - build performance
                    - support responsiveness
                    - needless interruptions
                - perhaps add some fun stuff to personalize the board
            ### Gaming
                - take down improvement charts once behavior has been established
            ### Indications
                - when your team has an informative workspace 
                    - you have up-to-the-minute information about all the important issues the team is facing
                    - you know exactly how far you've come and how far you have to go in your current plan
                    - you know whether the team is progressing well or having difficulty
                    - you know how well the team is solving problems

        ## Customer Examples
            - concrete examples illustrating domain rules
            ### describe
                - during task planning, create tasks for necessary Examples
                - err on the side of too many examples; domain experts and develoeprs both groups are surprised by misunderstandings
            ### Demonstrate
                - make rules concrete by asking domain expert for examples, not just rules 
            ### Develop
                - examples are some of the most important logic, be sure to document them
                - automated tests can be great documentation
                - creating examples can usually be the first development task
            ### Indicators
                - When your team uses customer examples well
                    - your software has few, if any domain logic bugs
                    - your team discusses domain rules in concrete, unambiguous terms
                    - your team often discovers and accounts for special-case domain rules that no-body had considered
        
        ## Done Done 
            ### How to be 'done done'
                - agile works best when you make a litle progress on every aspect of work every day
                - programmers use TDD and CI 
                - inovlve on-site customers, show them early progress even if it doesn't work
                - schedule additional stories if you discover unexpected work
            ### Making Time
                - team should finish 4-10 stories per week. the secret is to create smaller stories
            ### Organizational Constraints
                - try to resolve dependencies before starting work on any stories
                - definition should only include things in your control
            ### Indicators
                - when yout stories are 'done done'
                    - you avoid unexpected batches of work
                    - teams using iteratinos psread wrap-up and polish work throughout the iteratino
                    - on-site customers and testers have a steady workload
                    - customer acceptance takes only a few minutes
                    
    # Accountability
        ## Stakeholder Trust
            - the more successful agile is, the more worries grow (organizational antibodies)
            - unfair, illogical, but also the way people think.
            ### show Some hustle
                - energetic, productive work.
                - energized work, informative workspace, stakeholders demos, appropriate roadmaps.
            ### show some empathy
                - stakeholders in a scary situation:
                    - sponsors, product managers, key stakeholders' careers on the line, often devs aren't.
                    - devs often earn more than stakeholders, apparently w/o hard work and toeing of lines stakeholders have to
                    - devs often come to work later (though probably leave later too)
                    - to outsiders, devs often dont seem particularly invested in success
                    - experienced stakeholders have a long history of devs failing to deliver
                    - stakeholders used to devs responding to questions about progress/estimates/commitments w/ arrogance or technobable
                    - many stakeholders see big tech companies deliver software well, but theirs rarely does
                - not necessarily true, but think about what success and failure mean from the outside
            ### deliver on commitments
                - stakeholders can evaluate two results: working software and delivering on commitments
                - commitments make it possible for stakeholders to make commitments to their stakeholders
                - agile can make reliable commitments: make a plan you can achieve, then repeat, again and again
            ### Manage Problems
                - work on the hardest, most uncertain problems first
                - when you encounter a problem, let the whole team know about it. bring it up at next stand at the latest.
                - bring problem to stakeholders attention, larger problems right away.
                - stakeholders not upset by problems, but by being blindsided by them
                - bring mitigation strategies to stakeholders when bringing up problems
            ### Respect customer goals
                - resist cynical developer goals about scheudles and suits
                - propose creative solutions to goals
                - build trust directly with stakeholders by listening/engaging with them regularly
            ### Make Stakeholders look Good
                - keep track of the value you've brought 
            ### Be Honest
                - avoid covering up any lack of progress, defects, etc.
            ### Indicators
                - When your team establishes trust with your org. and stakeholders:
                    - stakeholders believe in your team's ability to meet their needs
                    - You acknowledge mistakes, challenges, and problems rather than hiding them until they blow up
                    - everyone involved seeks solutions rather than blame

        ## Stakholder Demos
            ### Feedback Loops
                - most important aspect of feedback is how surprising it is. if surprised, you need to work harder to understand them.
                - reactions of everyone involved is important too. happy/energized vs. burned/checked out.
                - who attends and who chooses not to is important.
            ### The Demo Cadence
                - start with weekly demos, or every iteration
                - invite everyone who might be interested
                - schedule right after end of an iteration
                - typically 30 minutes
            ### How to conduct a stakeholder demo
                - Anyone can host, but ideally whoever works most closely with stakeholders
                - begin by reminding attendees of the valuable increment the team is currently working on
                - provide an overview of stories worked on since last demo
                - explain any changes in plans that have been made
                - at the end, let everyone know how they can try the software themselves
            ### Be Prepared
                - before demo make sure all stories are 'done done'
                - review stories that have been finished since last demo and organize them into a narrative.
                - connect stories to team's increments and purpose and visual plan
            ### When things go wrong
                - dont fake progress, you're setting up unrealistic expectations
            ### Indicators
                - when your team conducts stakeholder demos well:
                    - you generate trust with stakeholders
                    - you learn what stakeholders are most passionate about
                    - the team is confident in its ability to deliver
                    - your'e forthright about problems, which allows your team to preven them from ballooning out of control

        ## Forecasting
            - the real secret to predicting well is to understand uncertainty and risk
            ### Predefined Release Dates
                - best way to forecast is to define when you'll release, but not what you'll release
                - you can adjust your plans when you encounter surprises
                - telling people exactly what you're going to do, you'll have to re-forecast a lot, or worse they're treated as commitments
                #### How to steer your plans
                    - secret to being ready on a given date is to slice work into smallest valuable increments
                    - increments need to be small enough that you can easily finish one before release date
            ### Feasability Forecasts
                - people with a lot of experience can make good gut decisions
                - gather team's sponsor, seasoned PM or two, and a senior dev or two, all with lots of experience.
                - ask when work starts, who is on the team, and the latest release date that could work
                - if answer is clearly 'yes', maybe worth investing in development. otherwise, there's risk.
            ### Date and Scope Forecasts
                - sometimes you need to predict 'when' and 'what'
                - to do so, requires accounting for schedule risks by adding some padding aka 'risk adjustment'
                - num weeks remaining = num stories remaining / weekly throughput x risk adjustment
                - num stories done by date = num weeks remaining * weekly throughput / risk adjustemnt
                - definitions:
                    - num weeks remaining: amount of time between now and your release date
                    - num stories: number of 'just right' stories that need to be completed before release date
                    - weekly throughoput: num stories finished last iteration
                    - risk adjustment: use 'high risk' team column unless your team has focusing and delivering fluency.
                - dependent on 'just right' sized stories. if you haven't broken them down as such, you can't forecast the release. use planning game.
                - all spike stories must be resolved before making forecasts
                - update forecast as the end of every iteration
            ### Reducing Risk
                - easiest way to reduce risk is making increments smaller
                - if you can answer these questions affirmatively, you can use 'low risk' metric
                    - did you have the same throughput in each of your last 4 iterations?
                    - were all of your stories 'done done' in last 4 iterations?
                    - did you add no new bug-fix stories in the last four iterations?
                    - for your most recent release, when your stories were done, were you able to release immediately?
            ### Custom Risk Adjustments
                - with a lot of data collection, you can create your own risk adjustment table
            ### Indicators
                - when your team forecasts well:
                    - how can coordinate with external events, such as marketing campaigns, that have long lead times
                    - you're able to coordinate with business stakeholders about upcoming delivery dates
                    - you understand when your team's costs will exceed its value
                    - you have data to counter unrealistic expectations and deadlines

        ## Roadmaps
            - takes a year or two of delivering reliably to generate trust
            ### Agile Governance
                - classic approach is 'project based' governance. project is funded if value exceeds costs.
                - this is predictive, not agile, assumes plans should be defined in advance
                - agile approach is 'product based governance'
                - allocate an ongoing 'business as usual' budget and estimate value the team will provide over time.
                - success is in terms of business results, such as ROI. 
                - 4 options, choose the least predictive allowed
            ### Option 1: Just the Facts
                - a description of what the team has done so far, with no speculation about the future
                - includes:
                    - your team's purpose
                    - what's complete and ready for next release
                    - your next release date
                    - current business value metrics
                    - current costs
                    - business model
                - can work well for sales and marketing
            ### Option 2: General Direction
                - speculation is kept to a minimum so team can adapt its plans
                - roadmap includes everything in 'just the facts' plus:
                    - valuable increment the team is currently working on and why it's the top priority
                    - valuable increment(s) to be worked on next
                - increments are presented without dates
                - optimizing teams may include hypotheses about business results of upcoming releases
            ### Option 3: Date and Approximate Scope
                - adds forecasted release dates ot the 'general direction' roadmap
                - reduces agility and increases risk as people take these as commitments
                - optimzing teams tend not to use this sort of roadmap as the business cost isn't worth the benefit
                - can be useful to coordinate with third parties
            ### Option 4: Detailed Plans and Predictions
                - least agile and greatest risk
                - more conservative forecasts, meaing more wasted time and less willingness to change
                - organizations prefer it as it feels safer, even though its the least safe
                - uncertainty makes people uncomfortable, and this lets them speak with certainty
                - certainty is an illusion; software development is inherently uncertain
                - if you have to do this, forecasts must include every story
                - optimizing teams dont use this sort of roadmap
            ### Corporate Tracking tools
                - agile planning tools are built for tracking and controlling teams, not enabling them, don't use them
                - mgmt keeps its hands on the wheel by iterating a team's purpose, demos, and using most adaptive roadmaps possible
                - if you are forced to use a tool, enter only minimal information and use other planning practices for day-to-day
            ### When your roadmap isn't good enough
                - the only way to deliver sooner is to cut scope
                - what happens when dates are missed? are they used as a bludgeon? no real consequences, just sacred commitments?
                - remember, best approach to forecasting is to choose a predefined release date and steer your plans accordingly.
            ### Indicators
                - when you use roadmaps well:
                    - managers and stakeholders understand what the team is working on and why.
                    - the team isn't prevented from adapting it's plans

        ## Management
            ### Theory X and Theory Y
                - Theory X believe workers dislike work and try to avoid it 
                - Theory Y believe workers enjoy work and are capable of self-direction
                - Measurement-based mgmt is Theory X, agile is Theory Y 
            ### The Role of Agile Management
                - agile managers manage work system rather than individual work
                - in practice they:
                    - make sure right people are on the team
                    - make sure team includes the right coaches
                    - mediate interpersonal conflict, help team members navigate chaos of change
                    - mentor individuals, encourage team-members to cross-train
                    - monitor the team's progress towards fluency
                    - procure the tools, equipment, etc. needed
                    - ensure team understands how its work fits into the big picture, has a charter, charter updated regularly
                    - provides insights about how well team is fulfilling its charter
                    - maintain awareness of relationships between team and its stakeholders
                    - advocate for team within the org, help team navigate beaurocracy and remove impediements to success
                    - ensure org. expectations around budgeting, governance etc. are fulfilled
            ### Measurement Dysfunction
                #### Stories and Story Points
                    - get more stories done, lower quality, more defects, lower productivity
                #### Code Coverage
                    - good tests are small, fast and targeted, which takes care and thought
                #### Lines of Code
                    - rewarding people for lines added/changed/deleted per day
                #### Say/Do Ratio
                    - making commitments a key value
                    - teams are conservative, work is expanded to fill time, reduced quality, more defects, etc.
                #### Defect Counts
                    - wasted energy on what to count. 
            ### Why Measurement Dysfunction is Inevitable
                - rather than do what achieves the best result, people will do what achieves the best score
                - too many things in software development can't be measured well
            ### Delegatory Management
                - focus on what intrinsicly motivates your team
                - inspire your team by showing how their work will fulfill their needs
            ### Make measurements inconsequential
                - try to amke it structurally impossible to misuse the data
                - keep information private to the team
                - aggregate the data, so it can't be attributed to one person. 
                - team managers see team measures; directors see departmental measures, etc.
            ### Go to gemba
                - to learn more about teams, go see for yourself
                - ask why teams aren't doing something already, and assume positive intent
            ### Ask the team
                - ask 'what can I do to help the team be more effective'
            ### Define goals and guardrails
                - managers role is to make sure the conversation happens, provide resources needed
            ### When Metrics are Required
                - if you must report something, provide narratives and qualitative information
                - try 'value velocity', measures output of the team over time
                - promise you won't use them in performance evaluations
            ### Indicators
                - when you use delegatory mgmt well:
                    - teams feel they've been set up for success
                    - teams own their work and make good decisions without management's active participation
                    - team members feel confident to do what leads to the best outcomes, not the best scores
                    - team members and managers arne't tempted to deflect blame and engage in finger pointing
                    - managers have a sophisticated, nuanced understanding of what their teams are doing and how they can help

    # Improvement
        ## Retrospectives
            - your team should constantly update and improve your development process
            ### Types of retrospectives
                - 'heartbeat retrospective' occurs on a regular basis
                - larger 'milestone' retrospectives give a chance to reflect more deeply
            ### How to conduct a heartbeat retrospective
                - whole team should participate, along with people who work w/ the team, but no one else
                - facilitators should switch
                - facilitator doesn't participate
                - keep everything confidential
                - five parts: set the stage, gather data, generate insights, decide what to do , close the retro
            ### Step 1: The Prime Directive (5 minutes) 
                - 'regardless of what we discover, we must understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could
                    given what was known at the time and thier abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand'. 
                - ask each attendee if they agree to the prime directive and wait for verbal 'yes'<div class=""></div>
            ### Step 2: Brainstorming
                - write the following on the whiteboard:
                    - enjoyable
                    - frustrating
                    - puzzling
                    - keep
                    - more 
                    - less
                - ask team members to reflect and use simultaneous brainstorming
            ### Step 3: Mute Mapping (15 minutes)
                - sort cards into clusters using mute mapping and choose one cluster
            ### Step 4: Generate Insights (10-30 minutes)
                - relaxed, freeform conversation, ask everyone 'why' things are important etc.
            ### Step 5: Retrospective Objective (10-20 minutes)
                - comes up with experiements that might make things better
                - determine a single objective, assign to someone to work the details out and follow through
                - wrap up with consent vote
            ### Follow Through
                - Make the objective visual (on task board?)
                - check in on it regularly (at stand up?)
            ### Indicators
                When your team conducts retros well:
                    - ability to develop/deliver software steadily improves
                    - whole team grows closer and more cohesive
                    - each speciality within the team gains respect for the issues other specialties face
                    - team members are honest and open about successes and failures
                    - team is comfortable with change
        
        ## Team Dynamics
            - your team's ability to work together is foundational towards the ability to develop and deliver software
            - teams are mutually accountable, have a shared history
        ## Team Development
            - forming, storming, norming, performing, adjourning
            ### Forming: the new kid in class
                - likely to see:
                    - excitement, anticipation, optimism
                    - pride in indivudual skills 
                    - concern about imposter syndrome
                    - an initial, tentative attachment to the team
                    - suspicion and anxiety about the expected team effort
                - with support, teams can move through this phase quickly
                - establish shared sense of strengths, personalities (chartering, connection-building exercises)
                - make sure team understands how they fit in
            ### Storming: Group Adolescence
                - team deals with disagreeable issues
                - expect:
                    - reluctance to get on with tasks
                    - wariness about continuous improvement approaches
                    - sharp fluctations in attitude about team and chance of success
                    - frustration with lack of progress or team members
                    - arguments between team members
                    - questioning wisdom of those who built the team
                    - suspicion of motives of people who appointed other members to the team
                - try to intervene in negative behavior
                - when you notice storming occuring, regroup the team to discuss trust:
                    - reflect on best trust stories
                    - reflect on times you have been trustworthy
                    - what's the core factor that engenders trust?
                    - what three wishses would you make to heighten trust and healthy comms on the team?
                    - don't shy away from conflict
            ### Norming: We're #1
                - teams make significant, regular progress towards their goals
                - you'll see:
                    - new ability to express criticism constructively
                    - acceptance and appreciateion of differences 
                    - relief that this just might all work out well 
                    - friendliness 
                    - sharing of personal stories, confidences 
                    - open discussions of team dynamics 
                    - desire to review and update working agreements and boundary issues with other teams
                - avoid groupthink
            ### Performing: Team Synergy
                - more than the sum of their parts, less emotion about interactions and tasks
                - you'll see these behaviors:
                    - significant insights into personal and team processes
                    - little need for coaching 
                    - collabration that's understanding of strengths and weaknesses
                    - positive remarks like 'i look forward to working with this team'
                    - confidence in one another
                    - preventing or working through problems and destructive conflicts
            ### Adjourning: Separating and Moving on
                - effective teams acknowledge this stage; conduct 'farewell' ceremonies 
            ### Communication, Collaboration, and Interaction
                #### Start with a strong base of trust
                    - at the beginning, focus on helping team mates find trust in each other; alignment chartering, psych. safety
                #### Support your growing trust with three-fold commitment
                    - from trust, you can explore:
                        - commitment to purpose
                        - commitment to each other's well being
                        - commitment to the well being of team as a whole
                    - discuss power dynamics openly
                #### Right-Size conflicts with feedback
                    - start appraoching things as 'us against the problem'
                    - focus on learning how to give and receieve good feedback
                #### Spark Creativity and Innovation
                    - make space for whimsy and inventive irrelevance
                #### Sustain high performance
                    - avoid complacency
            ### Shared Leadership
                - everyone leads, at times, and follows a peer leader at others
                - teams need all sorts of these leaders:
                    - pioneers
                    - instructors
                    - diplomats
                    - influencers
                    - followers
                    - commentators
                    - coordinators
                    - promoters
                    - critics
                    - gatekeepers
                    - contrarians
                    - reviewers
                    - monitors
            ### Toxic Behavior
                - any behavior that produces an unsafe environment, degrades team dynamics, or damages the team's ability to achieve its purpose
            ### Indicators
                - when your team has healthy team dynamics
                    - members enjoy coming to work
                    - members say they can rely on teammates
                    - members trust that everyone on teh team is commited to acheiving the purpose
                    - members know one another's strengths and support each other's limits
                    - members work well together and celebrate progress and success
        ## Impediment Removal
            - some members expect leadership titles to remove impediments, but it is a team responsibility. solve them yourself.
            ### Identifying Impediments
                - ask questions like:
                    - what slows us down?
                    - what do we need that we don't have yet 
                    - where could we make progress if only ..
                    - what stopped us or kept us from.. 
            ### Circles and soup
                - an exercise to identify which issues we can address now as a team
                #### Control: Take Direct Action
                    - when your team controls the solution to the impediment, take action and fix it
                #### Influence: Persuade or recommend
                    - create a chart to identify stakeholders who will help
                    - figure out who you have to work on to get support
                #### Soup: Change your response
                    - only option in this case is to change yourself
                #### Indicators
                    - when you remove impediments well:
                        - team learns to enjoy the challenge of clearing it's own way
                        - team addresses impediments as they come up
                        - team spends less time on removing impediments
                
# Section 3 - Delivering Reliabliy
    - Teams that are fluent at delivering
        - release their latest work, at minimal risk and cost, whenver their business stakeholders desire
        - discover and fix flaws in the production lifecycle early, before they can do damage
        - are about to provide useful forecasts
        - have low defect rates, so they spend less time fixing bugs and more time building features
        - create software with good internal quality, which makes changes cheaper and faster
        - have high job satisfaction and morale, which improves retention and performance

    - the team responds to business needs
        - the team's code is production-grade and the latest work is deployed to a production-equivalent environment at least daily
        - the team's business reps may release the team's latest work at will
        - the team provides usefuli release forecasts to its business reps upon request
        - the team coordinates with business stakeholders to develop in a way that allows its software to be 
            maintained, inexpensively, and indefinitely.

    - the team works effectively as a team
        - developers consider code and similar artifacts to belong to the team, not individuals, and they share 
            responsibility for changing and improving it
        - all day to day skills needed to design, develop, test, deploy, monitor, maintain, etc., the team's work are 
            immediately accessible to the team.
        
    - The team pursues technical excellence
        - when making changes, team members leave their software's internal quality a little better than they found it
        - the team actively responds to errors by improving the underlying system that made the error likely, reducing the probabilty of future errors
        - deploying and releasing is automated and takes no more than 10 minutes of manual effort
        - no manual testing is required prior to deployment
        - team members are aware of how their skills affect their ability to accomplish the team's goals and improve internal quality
            and they proactively seek to improve those skills.
        
    ## Achieving Delivering Fluency
        - XP's coding, testing, design practices remain state-of-the-art.
        - yield the highest-quality, most productive code.
        - combined with incremental planninga nd requirements analysis, allows teams to deliver high-quality software regularly and reliabily.

# Chapter Twelve 
    ## Collective Code Ownership
        - everyone is expected to fix the problems they find. 
        - it doesn't matter who wrote it; it's your code, fix it!
        ### Making Collective Code Ownership Work
            - task planning is a good time to start discussions about code design
            - ideally, teams will swarm each story and everyone will choose tasks for the same story
            - don't jump ahead just because you don't know how to coordinate
            - if not pairing, you may need a daily design review
        ### Egoless Programming
            - rather than taking pride in your code, take pride in your team's code. 
        ### Collaborating without Conflict
            - decide on important coding, design, arch. standards as part of alignment chartering
            - pairing/mobbing can help reduce conflict
        ### Working with Unfamiliar Code
            - volunteer to work on tasks you don't understand; then drive the keyboard w/ pairing.
        ### Benefits to Programmers
            - requires the organization values team contributions more than individual heroics
        ### Indicators
            - When your team practices collective code ownership well
                - everyone on the team constantly makes minor improvements to all parts of the code 
                - nobody complains about team members changing code without asking permission first
                - when you come back to code you originaly worte, you find that it improved without your involvement
                - when a team member leaves or takes a vacation, the rest of the team handles their work without interruption

    ## Pair Programming
        ### Why Pair?
            - one person acts as the driver, coding, the other the navigator, thinking
            - pairing reinforces good skills; less likely to take shortcuts
            - more time in flow with less distractions
        ### How to Pair
            - when you start working on a task, ask another programmer to work with you
            - try to rotate through working with all members of the team
            - when you get stuck, switch partners
            - good idea to switch several times per day
            - make sure both people align on how they want to pair before beginning
            - think out loud, pairs produce code through conversation
            - as you pair switch the driver and navigator roles frequently
            - expect to feel tired; pairs typically feel that they have worked harder and accomplished more
        ### Effective Navigating
            - be patient, let driver correct themselves, focus on the bigger picture
            - think about what's going to happen next and come prepared with suggestions
            - sometimes when questions arise, split up then regroup and share your learnings
        ### Teaching through Pairing
            - treat inexperience as a lack of knowledge that's easily rectified
            - good developer works quickly and well, the best help everyone do so
            - don't rush it, either as navigator or driver. let the student set the pace.
        ### Challenges
            - Pairing can feel awkward, feelings are natural and generally go away after a month or two
            #### Comfort
                a comfortable workspace is key
            #### Introversion / Social Anxiety
                - very focused on ideas and results, no need to engage in small-talk
                - if pairing might be dificult for someone on the team, talk about ways of making it more comfortable
            #### Communication Style
                - new drivers sometimes have difficulty involving their partner
                - consider 'ping-ponging', one person writes a test, the other person makes it pass and writes a new test
                - consider 'strong-style pairing', all ideas must pass through the other person's fingers
                - adopt an attitude of collaborative problem solving rather than blunt criticism
            #### Tools and keybindings
                - try to standardize on a particular toolset
        ### Indicators
            - when your team pairs well
                - you're focused and engaged throughout the day
                - you enjoy the camaraderie of working with your teammates
                - at the end of the day, you feel tired and satisfied
                - for small interruptions, one person can deal
                - internal quality imrpoves
                - knowledge and coding tips dispurse through the team
                - new team members integrate into the team quickly and easily
    ## Mob Programming
        ### How to Mob
            - one driver, many navigators
            - rotate driver quickly, maybe 7 minutes
            - many agile principles become automated: stand-ups, code ownership, team room, task planning..
        ### The Mobbing Station
            - when switching, driver pushes to a temp. branch and next pulls it down
        ### Making Mobbing Work
            - fun and easy, but tiring for the whole team every day
            #### Team Dynamics
                - Pay attention te team members and make sure everyone is being heard 
                - could be helpful to hold a retro at end of each day
            #### Energized Work
                - not dependent on any one person
            #### Research
                - When not driving, you can look things up, whiteboard, spike solutions
            #### Strict Navigator Role
                - maybe good to rotate one single navigator vs. everyone sharing
            #### Non-Programmers
                - Everyone can contribute
                - non-programmers may require direction at level of specific key-board shortcuts etc.
                - nobody is required to be a driver
                - try for more involvement rather than less
                - conversations about customer examples, stakeholder interview etc. can be beneficial for everyone
            #### Mini-mobs and part-time mobs
                - maybe have a few people mob while everyone else pairs
            #### Indicators
                - When your team mobs well
                    - the whole team directs its entire effort towards one story at a time, fishing with minial delays/wait time
                    - the team collaborates well and enjoys working together
                    - internal quality improves
                    - when a tough problem arises, the mob solves it while driver continues
                    - decisions are made quickly and effectively

    ## Ubiquitous Language
        - a way of unifiying the terms your team uses in conversation and code so everyone can effectively collaborate
        ### The domain expertise conundrum
            - people who understand the problem domain rarely can write software, and developers rarely understand the domain
            - overcoming this is an issue of communication
        ### Speak the same language
            - programmers should use the lagnuage of domain experts
        ### How to create a ubiquitous language
            - doesn't come free; ask experts for terms they use, sketch diagrams that model what you hear and get feedback
            - ask for examples when getting into tricky details
            - reflecting in code how users think and speak about their work, you expose gaps that result in bugs
        ### indicators
            - when you have a ubiquitous language that works:
                - you reduce miscommunication between customers and programmers
                - you produce code that's easier to understand, discuss, and modify
                - when sharing a room, experts overheard domain and implementation discussions

# Chapter Thirteen 
    ## Development
    ## Zero Friction
        ### One-Second Feedback
            - development speed is the most important area for eliminating friction; you need feedback in less than 5 seconds
            - less than 1 second feels instantaneous, less than 5 is acceptable, 5-10 it feels slow, more than 10 you can't take small steps
            - setup a watch script that automatically checks for changes and checks for errors
            - as things slow down, you'll need two builds, one for fast feedback and one for prod deploy
            - focus on what your team needs
        ### Know your editor
            - take the time to get to know your editor, really, really well.
        ### Reproducible Builds
            - a build that continues to work and pass its tests no matter which dev machine and how old the code is
            - require 2 things:
            #### Dependency Management
                - program your build to ensure that you have correct version of every dependency
            #### Local Builds
                - everything the code depends on needs to be installed locally
        ### Five-Minute Integration
            - your script should report success or failure within 5 minutes, ten at most.
            - doesn't need to complete, but at least pass some sanity checks quickly
        ### Control Complexity
            - teams pull in popular tools, libraries, frameworks to solve common dev problems
            - optimize for maintainance than for initial development
        ### Automate Everyhing
            - automate everything your team performs repeatedly
                - Build: compile, lint, tests
                - watch: auto-run build when files change
                - integrate: run build in prod-like environment
                - deploy: run integrate then deploy the branch
                - rundev: run software locally for manual review and testing
            - use real programming language for scripts
            - treat scripts with same respect as prod code
        ### Automate Incrementally
            - in a new codebase, your first dev tasks are to set up your scripts
            - create bare-bones 'build' and 'watch' scripts first with no real code behind them
            - next create a simple integrate script, does basic CI 
            - next flesh out build with dep-management and simple entry point
            - next add unit testing and failing test
            - now add rundev
            - finally create deploy, posting to a staging server
            - from this point on, update automation with every story
        ### Automating Legacy Code
            - start with simple scripts that just document what to do for ecah one
            - use your slack to gradually automate each step
            - provide targets that allow you to build and test each chunk of code in isolation
            - once you have a build target below 10 seconds, it's worth creating a 'watch' script
        ### Indicators
            - when your team has zero-friction development
                - you spend your time developing, not struggling with tools, checklists and dependency documentation
                - you're able to work in very small steps, wihch allows you to catch errors earlier and spend less time debugging
                - setting up a new development workstation is a simple matter of cloning a repo and running a script
                - you're able to integrate and deploy multiple times per day

    ## Continuous Integration
        - ultimate goal of continuous integration is to make releasing a business decision, not a technical decision. 
        ### CI is a practice, not a tool
            - many people think CI means using a CI server; not true!
            - releasing latest work at will requires 3 things:
                #### Integrate many times per day
                    - integration means merging together all the code the team has written
                    - integrate as often as possible, some teams even do every commit
                    - the more often you integrate, the less painful it is overall.
                #### Never break the integration build
                    - integration branch needs to be 'known-good', it must always build and pass its tests
                #### Keep the integration branch ready to release
                    - every story includes tasks needed to update the build and deployment scripts when needed
        ### Multistage Integration Build
            - contains two separate builds, the normal fast build, and the slower secondary build.
            - can help transition from asynchronous to sycnhronous integration
        ### Pull Requests and Code Reviews
            - PRs not a good fit for CI. too slow, instead use pairing or mobbing.
            - possibly perform code reviews after integrating.
            - can work well as a coordination mechanism between teams that don't share ownership
        ### Indicators
            - When you integrate continuously
                - deploying and releasing is painless
                - your team experiences few integration conflicts and confusing integration bugs
                - team members can easily synchronize their work
                - your team can release with the push of a button, whenever your on-site customers are ready
    
    ## Test-Driven Development
        - done well, TDD ensure that the code does exactly waht you mean, not just what you say
        ### Why TDD Works
            - every few minutes, TDD verifies the code does what you think it should do
        ### How to use TDD
            - tdd doesn't prevent mistakes; it reveals them
            #### Step 1: think
                - dont write any production code unless you have a failing test
                - sometimes thinking ahead is too difficult; use a spike solution
            #### Step 2: Red bar
                - when you know your next step, write the test
                - predict what will happen, then use your watch script to verify
                - if it doesn't fail as expected, understand why, you need to be able to predict
            #### Step 3: Green Bar
                - write just enough production code to get the test to pass
                - if you can't figure out the mistake quickly, start again from scratch, you've made too big a change
            #### Step 4: Refactor
                - once tests are passing, refactor as much as you like
            #### Step 5: Repeat
                - when you're ready to add new behavior, start the cycle again
                - the key to successful TDD is small increments and fast feedback
        ### Eat the onion from the inside out
            - core interface
            - calculations and branches
            - loops and generalizations
            - special cases and error handling
            - runtime assertions
        ### Indicators
            - when you use TDD well
                - you spend little time debugging
                - you continue to make programming mistakes, but you find them in a matter of minutes and can fix them easily
                - you have total confidence the whole codebase does what programmers intended it to do 
                - you aggressively refactor at every opportunity, confident in the knowledge the tests will catch any mistakes

    ## Fast, reliable Tests
        ### Rely on Narrow Unit Tests
            - broad tests seem like a good way to get coverage, but they're a trap
            - a narrow test is focused on a small amount of code
            - best tests are unit tests, fast and deterministic. likely means they run in memory.
            - vast majority of tests should be unit tests
        ### Test outside interactions with narrow integration tests
            - tests code that talks to the outside world
            - units tests can test hundreds or thousands per second, narrow integration tests maybe dozens per second
            - design your code to minimize the number of narrow integration tests required
        ### Simulate Nonlocal Dependencies
            - create infrastucture wrapper for external dependencies
        ### Control Global State
            - When you encouner a flaky test, fix it the same day
        ### Write Sociable Tests
            - try to avoid using doubles/mocks etc. as then you need more integration tests
        ### Separate infrastuctureand logic
            - purel ogic with no dependenciesis the easiest to test by far
        ### Use broad tests only as a safety net
            - just a few small smoke tests for most common scenarios 
        ### Adding tests to existing code
            - introduce  characterization tests as first, then slowly refactor
        ### Indicators
            - when you write fast, reliable tests
                - you don't 'fix' flaky tests by running the test suite again
                - your narrow integratino tests are proportional to the number of external services and components your code uses
                - you have only a small number of broad tests
                - your test suite average at least 100 tests per secondary
    ## Refactoring
        ### How to refactor
            - proceed in a series of very small transformations
            - read martin fowler's 'refactorings'
        ### Refactoringin Action
            - big example
            - look up gilded rose kata
        ### Indicators
            - when you use refactoring as an everyday part of your toolkit
                - the code constantly improves
                - you make significant design changes safely and confidently
                - every week, the code is at least slightly better than it was the week before

    ## Spike solutions
        - whenevery you're faced with a question, don't speculate, conduct an experiment.
        - a spike is a small experiment, usually less than a day, and the result is discarded
        ### Quick Questions
            - a REPL or throwaway test is quick and easy for simple language/library/tools questions
        ### Third Party Dependencies
            - for libs, frameworks, services, create a small standalone program to explore it
            - for complex deps like frameworks, do the tutorial
        ### Design Experiments
            - create a throwawy branch to experiment with, and not have to worry about anything breaking
            - if it doesn't work out, delete it, if it does, keep it around for reference
        ### Making time for Spikes
            - slack absorbs the cost, and sometimes warrants adding a spike story or task to the board
        ### Indicators
            - when you clarify technical questions with well-directed isolated experiemnts
                - rather than speculating, you conduct an experiment
                - complexities of production code don't interfere with your experiments



# Chapter 14
# Design
    - 'evolutionary design' proactively reduces the cost of change
    - without it, agile teams do collapse under the weight of unmaintainable code
# Incremental Design
    ## Never Stop Designing
        - with Pairing or Mobbing, at least have the programmers are dedicated to thinking about design, and TDD encourags you to improve design at every stage
    ## How Incremental Design Works
        - works with 'simple design' and 'reflective design'
            - simple design: start with simplest design that could possibly work
            - incremental design: when the design doesn't do everything you ned, incrementally add to it
            - reflective design: every time you make a change, improve the design by reflecting on its strengths and weaknesses
        - always start by being completely specific; don't try to solve more general problems
        - wait to introduce abstractions
        - the 2nd time you add to a design element, modify it just enough to solve the two problems it needs to solve
        - the 3rd time, generalize just enough to solve the 3 problems
        - continue, by 4th time it should be general enough for your needs
    ## Levels of Design
        - incremental design happens at all levels, from within a class to application architecture
        - quality tends to improve in bursts
        ### Within a class or module
            - refactorings happen every few minutes, during the 'refactoring' step of the TDD cycle
            - breakthroughs happen severeal times per hour, and often take a matter of minutes
        ### Across classes and modules
            - when you see a problem, add it to your notes and come back during a refactoring step of TDD
            - cross-module, cross-class refactorings happen several times per day. breakthroughs a few times per week, take several hours to complete.
        ### Application Architecture
            - breakthroughs in architecture happen every few months, can take several weeks or longer to refactor
            - refactor classes/modules as you work every day, and use slack to update other classes/modules
            - keep delivering stories while you refactor, don't take a break to refactor all at once.
            - balance technical excellence with delivering value, always.
            - could put an ARD 'architectural decision record' in the code
        ### Risk Driven Architecture
            - in any given week you'll have a certain amount of slack; give priority to architectural risks.
        ### Indicators
            - you you use incremental design well:
                - every week advances software's capabilities and design in equal measur
                - you have no need to skip stoires for a week or more to focus on refactoring or design
                - every week, the quality of the sotware is beter than it was the week before
                - as time goes on, the software becomes increasingly easy to maintain and extend

    # Simple design
        - always ask yourself "when I need to change this, how hard will it be?"
        - agile is the result of embracing Simplicity
        ### YAGNI: You aren't gonna need it
            - better not to speculate about what you might need.
            - remove code that's no longer in use
        ### Once and Only Once
            - express every concept once. and only once.
            - dont express concept with primitives, use a new type
        ### Coupling and Cohesion
            - parts of code are coupled when change to one necessitates change to another
            - code is cohesive when it's physically close together in source files
            - best code has low coupling. if there is coupling, it should be highly cohesive.
        ### Third Party Components
            - isolate 3rd party dependencies behind an interface you control
            - create wrappers incrementally, only exposing features you need
        ### Fail Fast
            - throw errors whenever you believe something shouldn't happen
        ### Self-Documenting Code
            - use idioms/patterns that are common for your language and team.
            - if introducing something new, run it by your teammates
        ### Published Interfaces
            - minimize published interfaces; very difficult to modify
        ### Performance Optimization
            - your intuition about performance is almost always going to be wrong
            - most of the time, slowness will be network, db, or filesystem
        ### Indicators
            - when you create simple designs:
                - your team doesn't write code in anticipation of future stories
                - your team finishes work more quickly, becuase they don't build things that aren't needed today
                - your design supports arbitrary changes easily
                - although new features might require a lot of new code, changes to existing code are localized and straightforward

    # Reflective Design
        - entities are not designed to be extended, but are designed to be modified
        ## How Reflective Design Works
            - don't speculate about the future; care about the change you're making right now
                1. look at the code you're about t work on.
                2. identify flaws in the design
                3. choose one thing to improve first
                4. incrementally refactor the code to reach the desired design
                5. repeat until your task is done
        ## Reverse-Engineering the Design
            - first step is to analyze code if you don't understand it; maybe ask somebody to explain it to you
            - a simple sketch of classes/files involved will help
        ## Identifying Improvements
            - don't look for ways to scrap everything; lok for problems that detract and restore/improve, don't re-invent. 
        ## Code Smells
            ### Shotgun Surgery and Divergent Change
                - shotgun surgery occurs when you have to modify multiple modules/classes to make a single change
                - divergent change is the opposite: when unrelated changes affect the same module or class
            ### Primitive Obsession and Data Clumps
                - primitive obsession when important design concepts are represented by generic types
                - data clumps occur when several variables always appear together
            ### Data Class and Code Class
                - put methods in the same class as the data they operate upon
            ### Squashed Errors and Coddled Nulls
                - handle errors only when you're able to provide a meaningful alternative
                - fail fast, don't return null or allow null
            ### Time Dependencies and Half-Baked Objects
                - don't force clients to manage an objects state
        ## Incrementally Refactor
            - make changes using a series of small refactorings
            - don't worry about making the code perfect
        ## Indicators
            - when you use reflective design well
                - your team constantly improves the design of existing code
                - when working on a task, programmers often refactor to make the task easier
                - refactorings are focused where they'll do the most good
                - the code steadily becomes easier and more convenient to work with
        
# Chapter 15 - Devops 
    - breaking down the walls between development, operations, and security allows teams to create software that's safer, more reliable, easier to manage
    ## Build for Operations
        - include people with operations and security skills as part of your team
        ### Threat Modeling
            - answer 4 questions to understand your system and how it can be compromised:
                1. what are you building?
                2. What can go wrong?
                3. What should you do about those things that can go wrong?
                4. Did you do a decent job of analysis?
        ### Logging
            - create user stories to answer what will be useful in an investigation
        ### Indicators
            - When you build for operations:
                - your team has considered and addressed potential security threats
                - alerts are targeted and relevant
                - when productino issues occur, your organization is prepared to respond
                - your software is resilient and stable

    ## Feature Flags
        - allows teams to deploy unfinished code without releasing it
        ### Keystones
            - when working on something new, wireup the UI last, there will be no way to access it
        ### Feature Flags
            - use code to control visibility, not a comment
            - be sure to remove them after they're no longer needed
            #### Application Configuration
                - pull the flag from a constant, env. variable etc.
            #### User Configuration
                - useful if you want to release a feature to a subset of users
        #### Indicators
            - when you use keystones and feature flags well:
                - your team can deploy software that includes incomplete code 
                - releasing is a business decision, not a technical decision
                - flag-related code is clean, well designed, and well tested
                - flags and their code are reomved after the corresponding feature is released
            
    ## Continuous Deployment
        - by deploying small pieces frequently, you reduce the risk that a big change will cause problems.
        ##  How to Use Continuous Deployment
            - has preconditions:
                - use CI to keep code ready to release
                - improve uality to the point it can be deployed without manual testing
                - use feature flags or keystones to decouple deployments from releases
                - establish moniotring to alert deployment failures
        ## Detecting Deployment Failures
            - monitor for error rates, performance issues, business metric issues
            - optionally use canary releases for phased rollouts
        ## Resolving Deployment Failures
            - when a deploy goes wrong, immediately 'stop the line' and focus on fixing the issue
            ### Roll back the deploy
                - blue/green is a simple way to rollback
            ### Fix the deploy
                - revert the changes so you're back to a good state 
                - schedule an incident analysis
            Alternative: Fix forward
                - just revert and deploy, can be slower than a dedicated roll-back
        ## Incremental Releases
            - for large or risky changes, run in production before you reveal to users
        ## Data Migration
            - 3 steps:
                - deploy code that understands both the new and old schema. deploy the data migration code at the same time
                - after deploy is successful, run the db migration code
                - when migration is complete, remove the old code then deploy again
        ## Indicators
            - When your team deploys continuously
                - deploying to production becomes a stress-free nonevent
                - when deployment problems occur, they're easily resolved
                - deploys are unlikely to cause production issues, and when they do , they're usually quick to fix

    ## Evolutionary System Architecture
        ### Are you Really gonna need it?
            - stackoverflow is one of the 50-highest trafficked sites and has a pretty low-tech system architecture
        ### Aim for Simplicity
            - what's the simplest architecture that will solve the current problems
            #### 1. Start with an ideal world
                - think about logical separate of components, regulatory concerns etc.
            #### 2. Introduce imperfect components and network
                - what's the simplest way to achieve fail-over 
            #### 3. Limit resources
                - don't speculate about future load, look at real usage and trends
            #### 4. Consider humans and Teams
                - do you need to split components to make cross-team communication easier?
        ### Controlling Complexity
            - some complexity is essential, others is accidental
            #### Evolutionary Design
                - splitting components tends to increase overall complexity, moves complexity fro application architecture to system architecture
            #### Self-Discipline
                - network calls enforce isolation; without them you need a disciplined team
            #### Fast Deployment
                - use zero friction builds, then you don't need to split a component to make deployments easier
            #### Vertical Scaling
                - design your architecture to match the problem, rather than designing to match your teams
            #### Refactoring System Architecture
                ##### Multirepo components -> Monorepo components
                    - combine several repos into one and factor out shared components
                ##### Components -> Microliths
                    - use separate directories instead of separate servers
                ##### Microliths -> Modules
                    - remove the top-level interface file and call the code normally
                ##### Modules -> New Modules
                    - more of an application architecture question
                ##### Big ball of mud -> Modules
                    - evolutionary design can transform it to modules
                ##### Modules -> Microliths
                    - introduce a top-level interface file and only allow calls through it
                ##### Microliths -> Components
                    - a lot of work, especially on the operations side
                ##### Modules -> Components
                    - jump straight from a module to a component, often via a re-write
                ##### Monorepo components -> multirepo components
                    - could be useful if moving ownership to another team
                ##### Compound Refactorings
                    - combine the above in series
        ### Indicators
            - when you evolve your system architecture well
                - small systems have small architecutres, large systems have manageable architectures
                - the sytem architecture is easy to explain and understand
                - accidental complexity is kept to a minimum

# Chapter 16 - Quality
    - Quality is not just about testing, it's about the way you approach your work, and build into everything
    ## No Bugs
        - Eliminate errors at their source rather than finding and fixing them after the fact
    ## Don't play the bug game
        - no reason to discern between 'bugs', 'defects', etc.
        - what really matters is whether you will do or not do something.
        - a bug is anything your team consdiers 'done' that later needs correction
        - if something needs work, it gets a story card
    ## How to build quality in 
        - keep internal quality as high as possible while keeping external quality at a level required by stakeholders.
        ### Prevent Programmers Errors
            - TDD
            - sensible hours, pair programming, mobbing to bring fresh and multiple perspectives.
            - supplement with good standards
        ### Prevent Design Mistakes
            - manfiest as complicated, confusing code that's hard to get right
            - use collective code ownership, evolutionary design, and slack to continuously improve
        ### Prevent Requirements Errors
            - team needs to include on-site customers with skills to understand, decide and explain the requirements
        ### Prevent Systemic Errors
            - every 'escaped' defect indicates a need to improve your dev system.
            - if you're are looking for bugs after building, use that as a clue to where your process needs to improve
            - if your team thought something was done and later needs fixing, consider an incident analysis
        ### Fix Bugs Immediately
            - if too big to fix quickly, have a huddle and see if there's enough slack to fix it
            - if not enough slack, decide if it's important enough to go into next release, or put in visual plan
            - if not important enough to fix, discard the bug
        ### Testers' Role
            - tend to focus on getting requirements right, collaborate with customers to iron out details
            - others are more technical, focus on investigating logs in production, performance, etc.
        ### `Tude
            - "bugs are for other people"
        ### Indicators
            - When your team has a culture of 'no bugs'
                - your team is confident in teh quality of its software
                - you're comfortable releasing to production without a manual testing phase
                - stakeholders, customers, and users rarely encounter unpleasant surprises
                - your team spends its time producing great software instead of fighting fires

# Blind Spot Discovery
    - when you fins a problem, fix the gap, think about what happened in the process that allowed the bug to occur
    ## Validated Learning
        - nobody really knows what you should build, not even the people asking for it
        - your job is to take those ideas, test them, and learn what you should really build
        - use the build-measure-learn loop
            1. build : what's the smallest thing we can put in front of real customers?
            2. measure: prior to showing anyone, decide what data you need to see to validate/invalidate the idea
            3. learn: if you validated the hypothesis, continue, otherwise change plans
        - don't assume delivering stories will be enough; do everything you can to avlidate assumptions and get feedback
    ## Exploratory Testing
        - a technique for finding blind spots
            1. charter: what you're going to explory and why, should give about an hour or two of work
            2. observe: use the software via UI, APIs, etc.observe anything you can; logs, db etc.
                - look for 2 things: anything out of the ordinary and anything you can modify (url, form field, etc.)
                - take notes as you go
            3. vary: think of ways to break the system
        - as you go, use your obesrvations to decide what to explore next.
    ## Chaos Engineering
        - deliberatly inject failures into running systems
            1. start with an understanding of the system's "steady state"; which parts of system most valuable to check first?
            2. prepare the vary the system in some way and form a hypothesis about what will happen
            3. make the change, observe what happens. 
    ## Indicators
        - When you use blind spot discovery well:   
            - the team trusts the quality of its software
            - the taem doesn't use blind spot discovery as a form of pre-release testing
            - the number of defects found in production and by blind-spot techniques declines over time
            - the amount of time needed needed for blind spot discovery declines over time

# Incident Analysis
    ## The Nature of Failure
        - failure is a consequence of the entire development system in which work is performed.
        - when failure occurs, it's because multiple things go wrong at once
        - systems exhibit a drift towards failure; stay vigilent, past successes don't guarantee future success
        - treat every failure as an opportunity to learn and improve
    ## Conducting the Analysis
        - involves 5 stages:
            1. set the stage
            2. gather data 
            3. generate insights
            4. decide what to do
            5. close the retrospective
        - involve the whole team; avoid managers and observeres
        ### 1. Set the Stage
            - safety is essential
            - remind everyone of the purpose: better understand the system that led to this
            - ask everyone to commit to the prime directive
            - consider establishing 'the vegas rule'
        ### 2. Gather dat
            - create a timeline, long horizontal whiteboard, to detail everything that happened
            - capture all events, even the ones that went well
            - be sure to include events about people, not just software
            - ask people to share recollections of their opinions/emotions at the time
            - ask participants to add additional stickies for those thoughts
            - ask people to highlight important events in the timeline
        ### 3. Generate Insights
            - mind the timeline for clues about your system
            - events aren't the cause, they're the symptom. remind everyone we're looking for that deeper system to analyze.
            - identify the events that involved people
            - assign one or more of the following categories to each people-involved event:
                - knowledge and mental models: info and decisions within the team involved in the event
                - comms and feedback: info from outside the team
                - attention: ability to focus on relevant info
                - fixation : persisting with an assessment in the face of new info
                - procedural adaptation: established procedure doesn't fit the situation
                - user experience: involves interaction with computer interfaces
                - write-in: anything else that doesn't fit.
            - write a conclusion for each event on the timeline
        ### 4. Decide what to do
            - brainstorm ways to make your system more resiliant
            - group them into control, influence, and soup circles
            - vote on which to pursue
        ### 5. CLose the retrospective`
            - review anything people don't want shared outside, remove before taking a picture
            - who will follow through on decisions and how?
            - wrap up witih expressing appreciation to antoehr for hard work
            
    ## Organizational Learning
        - try to show how the lesson affects the broader organization
    ## Incident Accountability
        - as the incident rate decreases, the fatality rate increases (continuous learning is vital)
    ## Indicators
        - when you conduct an incident analyses well
            - incidents are acknowledged and evn incidents with no visible impact are analyzed
            - team members see the analysis as an opportunity to learn and improve, and even look forward to it
            - your system's resiliancy improves over time, resulting in fewer escaped defects and production outages
            - no one is blamed, judged, or punished for the incident

# Part Iv. Optimizing Outcomes
    # Welcome to the optimizing zone
        - for teams who want to create more value
        - take ownerships of their plans, and budget, so they can experiment, iterate, and learn.
        - teams who are fluent at optimizing:
            - deliver products that meet business objectives and market needs (as opposed to delivering what they're asked to)
            - include broad-based expertise that promotes optimal cost/value decisions
            - understand where their products stand in the market and how they'll improve their position
            - coordinate with leadership to cancel or pivot low-value products early
            - learn from market feedback to anticipate customer neds and create new business opportunities
            - make business decisions quickly and effectively
        - the team responds to business needs:
            - the team describes its plans and progress in terms of business metric outcomes, jointly identified with management
            - the team collaborates with internal and external staekhodlewrs to determine when and how roadmaps will provide the best ROI
        - the team works as a trusted, autonomous team
            - the team coordinates with mgmt to understand and refine tis role in achieving the organizations overall business strategy
            - team members jointly take responsibility, and accept accountability, for achieving the business outcomes they identify
            - mgmt gives the taem the rsources and authority it needs to autonomously achieve its business outocmes
            - mgmt ensure that the team includes dedicate team mambers who have all the day-to-day skills the team needs to understand
                themarket and achieve its business outcomes
        - the team pursues product greatness:
            - the team angages with its customers and market to understand product needs and opportunities
            - the team creates hypotheses about business opportunities and conducts experiments to test them
            - the team plans and develops its work in a way that alows it to compleley change plans, without waste, given less than a month's notice
    # Achieving Optimizing Fluency
        - you'll need to demonstrate success with 'focusing' and 'delivering' fluency before getting the authority to try 'optimizing'
        
# Chapter Seventeen
    ## Autonomy
        - optimizing isn't rare because it's hard, it's rate because it requires autonomy that most orgs won't support
    ## Business Expertise
        - team needs the ability to make good decisions
        - optimizing teams have real bsuiness authority and expertise
        - everybody on the team takes an interest in producing value
        - you'll get the best results when your entire team sees its job as learning how to better serve customers, users, and stakeholders.
    ## Business Decisions
        - they lack emphasis on user stories; not the topic with stakeholders
        - mgmt knows they can trust the team and stand back. Team will let exec know what's being achieved.
        - optimizing teams rarely follow a predetermined plan. 
        - they don't usually have traditional deadlines
    ## Accountability and Oversight
        - they still have to show their work and justify big picture decisions. 
        - they just dont have to get advanced approval for their decisions.
        - the org. uses the team's purpose to provide direction/guardrails
        - team demonstrates accountability by what it's aachived, and what it hopes to achieve, in terms of business results.
    ## Funding
        - predictions about value will come true, or not; this can be used to adjust the team's purpose
# Chapter Eighteen
    ## Discovery
        - optimizing teams know that no-one knows what to build, and don't pretend to
        - the job is to discover what to build
    ## Validated Learning
        - you need real customers, and real costs to get real feedback
    ## Adaptability
        - keep planning horizons short and plans adaptable
        - 3 common categories of value:
            - direct value: you've built something that provides value in one fo the types described in 'what do orgs value'
            - learning value:
            - option value:
        - options value can be the best to focus on to ensure you can adapt
        - build a 'safety' increment to release in case the larger vision doesn't pan out
    ## Experiments and Further Reading
        
# Chapter Nineteen
    - Into the Future
        - once you understand a practice, make it your own. break the rules and see what happens.
        - perhaps consider team self-selection
        - strengthening zone is about bottom-up decision making
        - when your intuition leads to great software that serves a valuable purpose, you've mastered agile
